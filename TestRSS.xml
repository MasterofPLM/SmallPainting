                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The Philippine National Police (PNP) recorded another big spike in coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 infections.

Data from the PNP released Monday night showed that 134 police personnel have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 1,223.

PNP spokesman Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac said 130 of the patients are assigned in Calabarzon while the other four are in Metro Manila.

&amp;ldquo;This is a combination of fresh and late cases,&amp;rdquo; he said in a message sent through Viber.

The PNP previously had a sudden increase last June 26 wherein 60 of its personnel contracted the virus.

The death toll remains at nine while 501 or 40.96 have recovered, according to the latest report of the PNP.

PNP chief Gen. Archie Gamboa earlier said most of the police officers who contracted COVID-19 were deployed at quarantine control points or checkpoints.

While the number of infected police personnel keeps on increasing, Gamboa has downplayed its possible effects to their operations.

Gamboa explained they can still perform their mandate of maintaining peace and order as they will never run out of personnel.

&amp;ldquo;The PNP still has 209,000 personnel. It&amp;rsquo;s practically a small portion,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Gamboa added that majority of their infected personnel are asymptomatic.

The PNP is also monitoring 2,097 other police personnel who have symptoms or&amp;nbsp;interacted with COVID-19 patients.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Mayor Francis Zamora said yesterday he prefers that San Juan remain under general community quarantine (GCQ) amid a continued rise in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.

President Duterte is set to announce new community quarantine classifications today.

&amp;ldquo;Personally and speaking on behalf of San Juan, I would prefer to maintain our GCQ status because we need to achieve a balance between the economy and the health and safety of our people. This is what we need at this point,&amp;rdquo; Zamora said in an interview aired over CNN Philippines yesterday.

As COVID-19 cases surged with the shift to a relaxed community quarantine status from the strict lockdown in March, Zamora said allowing more people to leave their homes at this point might result in more cases.

&amp;ldquo;I would prefer a status quo, because a lot of people are out now &amp;ndash; you could see from our graphs in San Juan that around the third week of June, the number of positive cases started to rise,&amp;rdquo; he said, attributing the rise to the fact that people from other cities and nearby provinces entered San Juan.

As of July 12, San Juan has recorded at least 550 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 47 deaths and 313 recoveries.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The government gave motorcycle riders until July 19 to install the barriers approved by the National Task Force against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, Philippine National Police deputy chief for operations, said the barriers should be the same as the prototype models of the provincial government of Bohol and motorcycle ride-hailing app Angkas.

Eleazar said the one-week grace period will give motorcycle owners enough time to set up the two prescribed barriers.

During the period, policemen will not apprehend couples and live-in partners who are riding motorcycles without physical barriers.

&amp;ldquo;We will continue monitoring and warning those without barriers while citing or apprehending those with other violations,&amp;rdquo; Eleazar said in a statement.

The government recently allowed couples to ride motorcycles because of the lack of public transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also included are live-in partners and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community provided they are living under one roof.

Eleazar urged motorcycle riders to strictly follow the approved designs of the barriers and existing rules on back-riding.

The prototype design of the Bohol provincial government is attached to the motorcycle while the barrier of Angkas is worn by the rider.

Aside from the barriers, couples are also required to present identification cards and other documents proving that they are living in one house.

Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo A&amp;ntilde;o said the barriers are necessary in the event they will allow back-rding when quarantine measures are further eased.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The national government will deploy at least 348 police officers, including Special Action Force (SAF) commandos, and soldiers in Navotas to beef up security in the city, which will be placed on a 14-day residential lockdown from Thursday until July 29.

Mayor Toby Tiangco signed on Monday an executive order (EO) putting the entire city on lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 from several households.

&amp;ldquo;Contact tracing revealed that individuals confirmed to have COVID-19 come from the same family, therefore requiring a lockdown in order not to further spread the virus into the community,&amp;rdquo; the EO read.

According to the EO, there were 312 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Navotas for the month of June, of which 125 were recorded from June 24 to 30 when Metro Manila was under general community quarantine (GCQ).

The lockdown is also necessary in order not to &amp;ldquo;overwhelm&amp;rdquo; the city&amp;rsquo;s COVID-19 facilities with new cases, according to the EO. The lone Navotas City Hospital and the city&amp;rsquo;s two community isolation facilities have exceeded their capacity.

Vehicles passing through Navotas will only be allowed along C4, C3, North Bay Boulevard, Lapu-Lapu Avenue and Road 10.

Reinforcements

Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, Philipine National Police (PNP) deputy chief for operations, said the security contigent will reinforce the local police in implementing the lockdown to contain the movement of residents to contain the spread of the virus.

&amp;ldquo;Our task is to contain the unnecessary movement of people and keep all residents at home except for the medical frontliners and other people who are authorized to go out,&amp;rdquo; he said in a statement.

The security contingent consists of 100 police officers from the National Capital Region Police Office, 100 from the Northern Police District, 81 SAF troopers, 42 personnel of the Maritime Group and 25 Army soldiers.

SAF commandos will conduct regular patrol while the maritime police will patrol the city&amp;rsquo;s coastline.

Eleazar said the deployment &amp;ldquo;is part of the medical solution as it is focused on prevention of the transmission of the coronavirus.&amp;rdquo;

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Manila&amp;rsquo;s newly refurbished city hall clock tower, the country&amp;rsquo;s own version of London&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Big Ben,&amp;rdquo; is a new beacon of hope and pride for Manilans, Mayor Isko Moreno said over the weekend.

In a statement, Moreno said he ordered the clock tower painted gold so that it sparkles during the day and exudes a calming effect at night.

The clock is checked from time to time to ensure all its faces show the same time, he added.

Without going into detail, Moreno said more improvements will be done to the clock tower to make it one of Manila&amp;rsquo;s foremost attractions.

The clock tower, one of the biggest of its kind in the country, at 100 feet, was designed by Antonio Toledo and completed in the 1930s.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Less than 30 percent of 6,000 jeepneys allowed by the government to ply 49 routes in Metro Manila have been able to resume operations after public transport was suspended in March, a transport group said on Monday.

The figure means that fewer than 1,800 jeepney drivers are on the road.

The Alliance of Concerned Transport Organizations (ACTO) said many jeepney drivers have remained idle since the government approved the return of public utility jeepneys on July 3.

Majority of jeepney drivers found the guidelines set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for their return difficult, chief of which was the voluntary surrender of their franchise, ACTO president Efren de Luna said.

&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s painful is that surrendering our franchise &amp;ndash; no one would really do that because if we do, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be operators but rather individuals dreaming of having a livelihood,&amp;rdquo; De Luna said in an interview aired over Teleradyo on Monday.

Most drivers also failed in their bid to return to Metro Manila roads due to the lack of internet access and smartphones to make use of quick response or QR codes required by the LTFRB for them to resume operations.

The QR, a special barcode to be downloaded from the LTFRB website, would be used to prove that their vehicles were among the 6,000 jeepneys permitted to ferry passengers along the approved traditional jeepney routes in Metro Manila.

The LTFRB also required jeepney drivers to have a personal passenger insurance policy and to have their vehicles subjected to a roadworthiness test. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Three out of five Filipinos believe that China withheld information on COVID-19 from the world, the latest survey by the Social Weather Stations (SWS) showed.

The poll, conducted from July 3 to 6, indicated that 61 percent believe the accusation of other countries that China did not immediately share information on COVID-19 to the world, such as the severity of the disease and the number of deaths because of this virus.

Of the 61 percent who expressed the opinion, 28 percent &amp;ldquo;strongly believe&amp;rdquo; and 33 percent &amp;ldquo;somewhat believe&amp;rdquo; the accusation.

Twenty-three percent said they do not believe &amp;ndash; composed of 13 percent &amp;ldquo;somewhat not believe&amp;rdquo; and 10 percent &amp;ldquo;strongly not believe.&amp;rdquo;

This resulted in a net belief score of +38, classified by the SWS as &amp;ldquo;very strong.&amp;rdquo;

Fifteen percent of Filipinos were undecided on the matter.

SWS noted the net belief scores were &amp;ldquo;very strong&amp;rdquo; in all areas. It was highest in the Visayas (+43), followed by Metro Manila (+41), Mindanao (+38) and balance Luzon (+35).

Meanwhile, seven in 10 Filipinos who believe the accusation said China should be held accountable for the spread of the virus globally.

The&amp;nbsp;SWS&amp;nbsp;poll was based on a probability-based survey conducted using telephone interviews of 1,555 adult Filipinos, 18 years old and above, nationwide.Ding Cervantes

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; China slammed the Philippines&amp;rsquo; declaration of the South China Sea ruling by an international tribunal as &amp;ldquo;non-negotiable&amp;rdquo; with no possibility of &amp;ldquo;compromise&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;change,&amp;rdquo; as Beijing highlighted the consensus reached by the two countries on handling the arbitration case.

The Chinese embassy in Manila issued the statement Monday in response to Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.&amp;rsquo;s pronouncement that certain actions of China within the Philippines&amp;rsquo; exclusive economic zone (EEZ) &amp;ldquo;violated the Philippines&amp;rsquo; sovereign rights and were thus unlawful.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;It has to be highlighted that China and the Philippines have already reached consensus on properly handling the so-called arbitration case, which has laid down solid ground for the turning-around of bilateral relations,&amp;rdquo; the embassy said.

In recent years, the embassy said China-Philippines relations have maintained healthy and steady momentum, with exchanges and cooperation in various fields making continuous progress.

&amp;ldquo;This serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples and contributes to peace and stability in the South China Sea. The two sides have also established the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea (BCM), returning to the right track of resolving relevant issues through bilateral negotiation and consultation,&amp;rdquo; it said.

&amp;ldquo;It is hoped that the Philippines could make concerted efforts with China in jointly securing the hard-won sound momentum of bilateral relations and upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea,&amp;rdquo; the embassy said.

On Sunday, Locsin said China&amp;rsquo;s compliance with the award would be consistent with the obligations of the Philippines and China under international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) to which both parties are signatories.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Seven in 10 Filipinos believe the government should assert its rights over islands in the West Philippine Sea, results of the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey revealed yesterday.

To the statement, &amp;ldquo;The Philippine government should assert its rights over the islands in the West Philippine Sea as stipulated in the 2016 decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration,&amp;rdquo; 70 percent agreed and 13 percent disagreed, for a net agreement score of +57, classified by the SWS as &amp;ldquo;extremely strong.&amp;rdquo;

Fifteen percent were undecided on the matter, the pollster said.

The nationwide net agreement score, however, fell from +82 in June 2019 to +57 in July 2020. It also fell in all areas, down by 31 points in Mindanao, 30 points in balance Luzon, 20 points in Metro Manila and 18 points in the Visayas.

Net agreement was highest in Metro Manila (+65), followed by the Visayas (+59), balance Luzon at (+57) and Mindanao (+52).

Meanwhile, four out of five Filipinos believe the Philippines should form alliances with countries that are ready to help defend the country&amp;rsquo;s territorial rights in the West Philippine Sea.

To the statement, &amp;ldquo;The Philippines should form alliances with other democratic countries that are ready to help us in defending our territorial rights in the West Philippine Sea,&amp;rdquo; 82 percent agreed and nine percent disagreed, resulting in a net agreement score of &amp;ldquo;extremely strong&amp;rdquo; +73.

Those who agreed with the view comprised 56 percent who &amp;ldquo;strongly agree&amp;rdquo; and 25 percent who &amp;ldquo;somewhat agree.&amp;rdquo;

Those who disagreed with the statement consisted of five percent who &amp;ldquo;somewhat disagree&amp;rdquo; and five percent who &amp;ldquo;strongly disagree.&amp;rdquo;

Eight percent were undecided on the matter, the SWS said.

By area, net agreement was highest in balance Luzon (+75), followed by Metro Manila (+72), the Visayas (+74) and Mindanao (+67).

SWS said a similar test statement was fielded in June 2019 and found 84 percent saying it is right for the Philippine government to form alliances with other countries that are ready to help in defending its security in the West Philippine Sea.

This opinion, it said, was widespread in all areas: 88 percent in the Visayas, 87 percent in balance Luzon, 84 percent in Metro Manila and 76 percent in Mindanao.

The poll on the Filipino public&amp;rsquo;s opinion about China was sponsored by the Stratbase Albert Del Rosario (ADR) Institute and was presented by the SWS at a virtual conference organized by the institute yesterday.

The SWS survey was based on a probability-based conducted using telephone interview of 1,555 adult Filipinos, 18 years old and above, nationwide.

The survey was released two days after the Philippines marked the fourth anniversary of its arbitral case victory over China.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said despite China&amp;rsquo;s intransigence, the Philippines will not renounce its friendly relations with Beijing. He said the country won&amp;rsquo;t allow itself to be hostaged by the rivalry between the US and China.

&amp;ldquo;The great powers as they escalate their rivalry will woo us into their side, we will be sure that we will advance our national interest and meanwhile we want all parties involved to abide with the rule of law, particularly with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea,&amp;rdquo; Roque said at a virtual press briefing.

But Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana called on China to comply with the 2016 arbitral ruling.

&amp;ldquo;We strongly agree with the position of the international community that there should be a rules-based order in the South China Sea,&amp;rdquo; he said.

&amp;ldquo;It is in the best interest of regional stability that China heed the call of the community of nations to follow international law and honor existing international agreements,&amp;rdquo; he said.

&amp;ldquo;Moving forward, we continue to push for the finalization of a substantive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea to settle disputes and prevent the escalation of tensions in the region,&amp;rdquo; he added.

Senate President Vicente Sotto III also said the Philippines should strongly assert its position.

&amp;ldquo;We should never give up the fight for what is legally ours. We should never cower in fear from the harassment and political intimidation that foreign governments impose on us,&amp;rdquo; Sotto said in a statement.

&amp;ldquo;What is unlawful can never be made lawful by the whims and caprices of a foreign power which treats the entire South China Sea as its territory,&amp;rdquo; Sotto said.

&amp;ldquo;We shall never and should not shut up into giving up our offshore treasures. Let us continue to hold hands in our fight for our sovereign rights,&amp;rdquo; he said. Christina Mendez, Paolo Romero, Michael Punongbayan

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Mass testing is key to containing the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and accelerating economic recovery, Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion said yesterday.

&amp;ldquo;Test, test, test and isolate is the only way to save the jobs and livelihoods of our Filipino people,&amp;rdquo; Concepcion said at a Balik Kabuhayan webinar with health experts, government officials and businessmen.

&amp;ldquo;To date, Project ARK has tested 107,782 individuals, with private companies carrying out 66,617 tests and LGU partners finishing 41,665 tests. We have to test millions of people. That&amp;rsquo;s the only way to create visibility,&amp;rdquo; he said.

&amp;ldquo;The revelation here is early on, there was a debate to test only symptomatic and not asymptomatic. The results from the private sector showed that if we did not test the asymptomatic, then this could have escalated to a worse situation,&amp;rdquo; Concepcion said.

&amp;ldquo;As we open more of our economy, we need to create more visibility and come up with a defense strategy to co-exist with the virus. We have to maintain our GCQ status and eventually move to MGCQ,&amp;rdquo; Concepcion maintained, referring to general community quarantine and modified general community quarantine.

Rep. Joey Salceda, one of the panelists, said opportunities abound and that confidence is vital to attaining goals.

&amp;ldquo;Focus on secular, keep the powder dry versus opportunity for quick recovery, build structural reforms and seize low-lying fruits,&amp;rdquo; Salceda said.

ARK PCR private sector chief implementor Janette Garin said Project ARK&amp;rsquo;s mission is to make testing affordable, available and accessible.

&amp;ldquo;Ideally from P1,500-P2,000 we aim to further reduce the cost of testing to P350 to P375 by the end of July via pooled testing,&amp;rdquo; she said.

&amp;ldquo;When a workplace becomes infected or exposed, operations have to be suspended. This means loss of income, difficult life; small businesses will close down. When health meets the economy, when testing fills the gap in making social distancing, hygiene practices and other new normal behaviors more effective, we can co-exist with COVID,&amp;rdquo; she added.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Tropical Depression Carina moved away from the country yesterday after dumping heavy rains over most parts of Luzon on Monday.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) lifted all tropical cyclone wind signals in Northern Luzon as of 5 p.m. yesterday.

However, PAGASA said the coastal areas in extreme Northern Luzon may still experience intermittent gusts.

As of 4 p.m., the center of Carina was spotted at 140 kilometers west northwest of Basco, Batanes, packing winds of 45 kilometers per hour near the center and gustiness of up to 55 kph.

It was moving northwest slowly.

Carina was forecast to weaken into a low pressure area last night or this morning.

PAGASA also warned against moderate to rough seas of up to 3.1 meters high over the seaboards of&amp;nbsp;Batanes, Ilocos Norte, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands and Isabela in the next 24 hours.

&amp;ldquo;Those with small sea craft are advised not to venture out to sea,&amp;rdquo; the weather bureau said.

Carina is the third tropical cyclone to enter the country this year and the first weather disturbance this month.

PAGASA has predicted two to four cyclones to enter the Philippine area of responsibility this July.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday underscored the need to shorten the country&amp;rsquo;s turnaround time for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing, but this must be coupled with &amp;ldquo;speedy&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;contact tracing.

The ideal time for results of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to be out is only 24 hours so as to initiate contact tracing immediately thereafter if the result is positive, according to WHO Representative to the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe.

&amp;ldquo;The shorter the period is, the earlier the contact tracing and suppression measures can happen,&amp;rdquo; Abeyasinghe said during a media forum organized by the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines.

As of July 10, the average turnaround time for PCR test results was 50 hours, while it was 24 to 48 hours with the GeneXpert tests.

Abeyasinghe emphasized that testing should be coupled with stronger contact tracing and isolation.

He said the information gathered in contact tracing, such as the &amp;ldquo;events and avenues where people are getting infected,&amp;rdquo; should be shared with the public so they can take measures on their own to avoid these &amp;ldquo;avenues and situations.&amp;rdquo;

If well informed, he said the public could also adopt behaviors to protect themselves.

&amp;ldquo;In countries where testing and quarantining facilities (are) of good standard, we see that testing results are available within a few hours, and this is followed by rapid identification of contacts and quarantining and isolation and for the testing,&amp;rdquo; he maintained.

By increasing the testing and contact tracing capacity, it is only expected to see many cases, according to the WHO official.

What is worrisome, however, is the &amp;ldquo;very increasing&amp;rdquo; positivity rate, from 6.5 two weeks ago to the current 7.7 percent as of Monday, he said.

Positivity rate pertains to the percentage of individuals who test positive for the virus.

&amp;ldquo;It is continuing transmission, so it is also reflected by the increased number of admissions that happen in a hospital,&amp;rdquo; Abeyasinghe said.

1 M COVID tests surpassed

Meanwhile, the government has surpassed its target of one million COVID-19 tests and is on its way to its target of 10 million tests by June next year, National Action Plan against COVID-19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon announced yesterday.

&amp;ldquo;It will be remembered that this is the target we set last month. Now, we haven&amp;rsquo;t even reached half of July, yet we have exceeded one million,&amp;rdquo; Dizon, concurrent chair of the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA), said in a statement.

&amp;ldquo;But it&amp;rsquo;s still not enough; it&amp;rsquo;s just a start. It&amp;rsquo;s reflective of the challenges that we face in the first couple of months, and with the work that the Department of Health has done in the past months, our testing capacity is already high,&amp;rdquo; he said as he thanked all Metro Manila mayors for their efforts.

Dizon noted that &amp;ldquo;as of July 12, there are 85 testing laboratories nationwide from only one in February, which will further ramp up the country&amp;rsquo;s testing capacity, along with the government&amp;rsquo;s aggressive implementation of the Test, Trace, Isolate and Treat strategy.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;The Philippines is also fast approaching its target to conduct 30,000 tests per day by the end of July, with 25,000 tests conducted daily as of July 9, from 561 tests conducted per day in March,&amp;rdquo; he said.

&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s just go on. With the help of local government units and the private sector, we must boost more our testing capacity because this is the only way for us to track down those afflicted in our communities and isolate them to prevent the contagion and slow down the spread of COVID-19,&amp;rdquo; he added.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The Supreme Court (SC) yesterday announced that it would consolidate all the eight petitions questioning the constitutionality of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.

SC spokesman Brian Keith Hosaka said the four latest petitions involving Republic Act 11479 or the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 &amp;ldquo;have also been consolidated together with the four earlier petitions consolidated last week.&amp;rdquo;

The SC decided to merge the four new petitions filed by former Office of the Government Corporate Counsel chief Rudolph Philip Jurado; the Center for Trade Union and Human Rights (CTUHR); Christian Monsod and Felicitas Arroyo, two framers of the 1987 Constitution, with the Ateneo Human Rights Center; and Sanlakas with the first four petitions.

The first four petitions were filed by&amp;nbsp;civil leaders and lawyers led by Howard Calleja and former Department of Education (DepEd) secretary Bro. Armin Luistro, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, the group of Far Eastern University (FEU) College of Law Dean Melencio Sta. Maria Jr. and FEU law professors and the Makabayan bloc of the House of Representatives.

Last July 7, the SC ordered the consolidation of the first four petitions.

President Duterte was named respondents in three of the petitions &amp;ndash; those filed by the Makabayan bloc, CTUHR and Sanlakas.

Aside from Duterte, named respondents in all or some of the eight petitions filed were&amp;nbsp;Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) chairman Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and its members, namely National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr., Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Interior Secretary Eduardo A&amp;ntilde;o, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, Information and Communications Secretary Gregorio Honasan II, Anti-Money Laundering Council executive director Mel Georgie Racela,&amp;nbsp;Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Felimon Santos Jr., Philippine National Police chief Gen. Archie Gamboa, the Senate of the Philippines and the House of Representatives.

The SC had given the respondents in the four latest petitions 10 days to file their comments to the Court.

Many of the petitioners raised the legality of the anti-terrorism law and the 14-day period of detention that can be extended to 10 more days. It reportedly goes beyond the three-day detention allowed in the Constitution.

In his petition, Jurado said the anti-terrorism law was unconstitutional because it gives the ATC the authority to waive the right of the detainee, while Sanlakas raised fears that their mass actions and protests would be misunderstood as acts of terrorism under the new law.

Duterte assures Muslims

President Duterte has assured Muslims that he is not out to kill them in the wake of fears that the controversial anti-terrorism law would be used against them.

Some sectors are worried that the law may be used to target critics of the administration, suppress liberties and discriminate against Muslims.

Duterte did not mention the law in his address before soldiers and Sulu Gov. Sakur Tan in Jolo last Monday. The President, however, described as nonsense claims that he is after Moros.

&amp;ldquo;Wala akong agenda na patayin ang mga Moro. Wala... katarantaduhan &amp;rsquo;yan (I have no agenda to kill Moros. That&amp;rsquo;s nonsense),&amp;rdquo; Duterte said.

&amp;ldquo;And I say you cannot do it, and why should you do it? I&amp;rsquo;m glad you are here listening,&amp;rdquo; he added, referring to Tan.

Among the new law&amp;rsquo;s provisions questioned are those that permit the pre-trial detention of suspected terrorists; enumerate acts of terrorism; punish persons who threaten to commit acts of terrorism and incite others to commit terrorism through speeches, writings, proclamations, banners or other representations.

The latest petition was filed by multi-sectoral alliance Sanlakas, which stated that the &amp;ldquo;subjective features&amp;rdquo; of terrorism would depend on the perceptions of law enforcers or soldiers.

Some lawmakers from Mindanao have also expressed concern over the bill, saying it would make Muslims and Lumads vulnerable to terrorist-tagging. Alexis Romero, Rhodina Villanueva

Sarah Lou Arriola, Undersecretary for migrant workers affairs of the DFA, told the House public accounts committee headed by Rep. Mike Defensor that they can carry out the repatriation &amp;ldquo;with the assistance of other government agencies.&amp;rdquo;

At the same time, she also announced that there will be two consecutive Philippine Airlines flights to Qatar this month &amp;ndash; on July 17 and 19 &amp;ndash; to ferry OFWs with confirmed PAL tickets. The latter flight will be a chartered one.

&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re also working on another chartered flight before the end of the month,&amp;rdquo; Arriola told Defensor and vice-chairman Rep. Jonathan Sy-Alvarado, whose committee has been conducting a probe on the repatriation of thousands of stranded OFWs.

The DFA official said each PAL plane can carry about 350 passengers.

Arriola also disclosed that Vietnam has finally allowed PAL to fetch about 80 stranded OFWs in Vietnam on July 25. &amp;ldquo;That is the final date. And yes, they&amp;rsquo;re coming home very soon,&amp;rdquo; she told the lawmakers.

At the first committee hearing on the issue two weeks ago, labor and foreign affairs officials promised to repatriate more workers, then numbering 167,000, including 88,000 in Saudi Arabia.

The officials blamed their failure to bring in more workers on the daily limit of 1,000 workers set by the inter-agency task force (IATF) on COVID-19 response.

&amp;ldquo;They committed to bring this problem to the attention of IATF and to arrange for more repatriation flights. Since the IATF has relaxed travel restrictions, it should allow more inbound planes &amp;ndash; whether commercial or charter &amp;ndash; bringing in stranded OFWs,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Those to be flown home include more than 300 who died in Saudi Arabia.

&amp;ldquo;We should bring our modern-day heroes home &amp;ndash; both the living and the dead &amp;ndash; as soon as possible to be reunited with their families,&amp;rdquo; Defensor said.

He said his committee has been told that at least 16,000 stranded OFWs already had their plane tickets and exit permits from their employers and host countries.

He pointed out that once the go-signal is given, the 16,000 workers would be home in days &amp;ldquo;at no cost to the government.&amp;rdquo;

Of the 16,000, 8,000 are in Saudi Arabia, up to 4,000 in the United Arab Emirates and another 4,000 in Qatar.

Defensor said it is the consensus among members and officials of the House led by Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano to appeal to the IATF and Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines to lift restrictions on repatriation flights and to arrange for additional transportation for the stranded OFWs.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Metro Manila is likely to remain under general community quarantine (GCQ) and Cebu City under the strictest enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) for the rest of the month.

National Task Force (NTF) against COVID-19 spokesman Restituto Padilla Jr. raised the scenario in an interview with &amp;ldquo;The Chiefs&amp;rdquo; Monday night on One News / TV 5.

He said there are still many hotspots being monitored in the National Capital Region (NCR), especially Navotas which will undergo a city-wide two-week lockdown beginning tomorrow because of rising cases.

&amp;ldquo;We see some of this in many areas of Metro Manila and instead of placing the entire Luzon on lockdown, the entire NCR on lockdown, let&amp;rsquo;s localize,&amp;rdquo; he explained.

&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s why we brought down the fight to the level of our tactical troops and that tactical troops are actually our mayors, our barangays, our municipalities,&amp;rdquo; he said.

As for Cebu City, Padilla said the locality might stay under ECQ despite the improving situation.

&amp;ldquo;Cebu will stay as is for now. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the final decision, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pre-empt, but it&amp;rsquo;s good the situation is improving,&amp;rdquo; he said in Filipino.

Padilla said the fatality rate in Cebu City is not as high as the national average and bed capacities in hospitals are no longer at maximum limits. The number of recoveries has also risen, he said.

&amp;ldquo;So from the time we started, where everything was almost critical, there is now steady improvement. The people just need to follow rules,&amp;rdquo; he added.

Imposing quarantine restrictions requires a delicate balancing between public health and the economy.

On the issue of hospitals reaching critical care capacity, Padilla said it should actually be attributed to the government&amp;rsquo;s improved testing capacity.

One solution, he explained, is to bring the mild and asymptomatic cases to isolation facilities instead of letting them stay in hospitals, which should prioritize severe cases.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The United States says it will no longer tolerate China&amp;rsquo;s actions aimed at building a &amp;ldquo;maritime empire&amp;rdquo; in the South China Sea.

It also condemned as &amp;ldquo;unlawful&amp;rdquo; Beijing&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;bullying&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;intimidation&amp;rdquo; of its smaller neighbors to control resources in disputed waters.

US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo made the statement on the fourth anniversary on Sunday of the issuance by an international tribunal of a ruling invalidating Beijing&amp;rsquo;s expansive claim in the South China Sea and reaffirming the Philippines&amp;rsquo; maritime entitlements.

&amp;ldquo;The world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire. America stands with our Southeast Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law,&amp;rdquo;
&amp;nbsp;Pompeo said in a statement.

&amp;ldquo;We stand with the international community in defense of freedom of the seas and respect for sovereignty and reject any push to impose &amp;lsquo;might makes right&amp;rsquo; in the South China Sea or the wider region,&amp;rdquo; he said.

China calls the US accusation completely unjustified.

Pompeo pointed out that Beijing uses intimidation to undermine the sovereign rights of Southeast Asian coastal states, bully them out of offshore resources, assert unilateral dominion and replace international law with &amp;ldquo;might makes right.&amp;rdquo;

In 2010, then Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi told his ASEAN counterparts that &amp;ldquo;China is a big country and other countries are small countries and that is just a fact.&amp;rdquo;

Pompeo said China&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;predatory world view has no place in the 21st century.&amp;rdquo; He emphasized that China has no legal grounds to unilaterally impose its will on the region.

Beijing&amp;rsquo;s basis for claiming almost the entire South China Sea is its so-called &amp;ldquo;nine-dash line,&amp;rdquo; formally announced in 2009.

In a landmark ruling on July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague found no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to the South China Sea. The tribunal also ruled that Beijing had breached the sovereign rights of the Philippines, which brought the case. Beijing vowed not to honor the ruling.

&amp;ldquo;The Tribunal sided squarely with the Philippines, which brought the arbitration case, on almost all claims,&amp;rdquo; Pompeo said.

He stressed the Arbitral Tribunal&amp;rsquo;s decision is final and legally binding to both parties.

&amp;ldquo;Today we are aligning the US position on the PRC&amp;rsquo;s maritime claims in the SCS with the Tribunal&amp;rsquo;s decision,&amp;rdquo; he added. PRC stands for People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China.

According to Pompeo, China cannot lawfully assert a maritime claim, including any Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims derived from Panatag (Scarborough) Reef and the Spratly Islands &amp;ndash; vis-a-vis the Philippines in areas that the Tribunal found to be in the Philippines&amp;rsquo; EEZ or on its continental shelf.

&amp;ldquo;Beijing&amp;rsquo;s harassment of Philippine fisheries and offshore energy development within those areas is unlawful, as are any unilateral PRC actions to exploit those resources,&amp;rdquo; Pompeo said, referring to islets, reefs and other land features in the West Philippine Sea being claimed by China.

&amp;ldquo;In line with the Tribunal&amp;rsquo;s legally binding decision, the PRC has no lawful territorial or maritime claim to Mischief (Panganiban) Reef or Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, both of which fall fully under the Philippines&amp;rsquo; sovereign rights and jurisdiction, nor does Beijing have any territorial or maritime claims generated from these features,&amp;rdquo; he said.

He also said Beijing has no lawful, coherent maritime claim over areas within the territorial waters of other countries in the region like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.

&amp;ldquo;As such, the United States rejects any PRC maritime claim in the waters surrounding Vanguard Bank (off Vietnam), Luconia Shoals (off Malaysia), waters in Brunei&amp;rsquo;s EEZ and Natuna Besar (off Indonesia),&amp;rdquo; Pompeo said. &amp;ldquo;Any PRC action to harass other states&amp;rsquo; fishing or hydrocarbon development in these waters &amp;ndash; or to carry out such activities unilaterally &amp;ndash; is unlawful.&amp;rdquo;

Pompeo also noted that China has no lawful territorial or maritime claim over James Shoal, an entirely submerged feature only 50 nautical miles from Malaysia and some 1,000 nautical miles from China&amp;rsquo;s coast. James Shoal is often cited in China&amp;rsquo;s propaganda as the &amp;ldquo;southernmost territory of China.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;International law is clear: An underwater feature like James Shoal cannot be claimed by any state and is incapable of generating maritime zones. James Shoal (roughly 20 meters below the surface) is not and never was PRC territory, nor can Beijing assert any lawful maritime rights from it,&amp;rdquo; Pompeo stressed.

Responding to Pompeo&amp;rsquo;s statement, China said the US &amp;ldquo;deliberately distorts the facts and international law,&amp;rdquo; including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

&amp;ldquo;The United States is not a country directly involved in the disputes. However, it has kept interfering in the issue. Under the pretext of preserving stability, it is flexing muscles, stirring up tension and inciting confrontation in the region,&amp;rdquo; the Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement.

&amp;ldquo;We advise the US side to earnestly honor its commitment of not taking sides on the issue of territorial sovereignty, respect regional countries&amp;rsquo; efforts for a peaceful and stable South China Sea and stop its attempts to disrupt and sabotage regional peace and stability,&amp;rdquo; the embassy said.

PRC stands for People&rsquo;s Republic of China.</p><p>According to Pompeo, China cannot lawfully assert a maritime claim, including any Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims derived from Panatag (Scarborough) Reef and the Spratly Islands &ndash; vis-a-vis the Philippines in areas that the Tribunal found to be in the Philippines&rsquo; EEZ or on its continental shelf.</p><p>&ldquo;Beijing&rsquo;s harassment of Philippine fisheries and offshore energy development within those areas is unlawful, as are any unilateral PRC actions to exploit those resources,&rdquo; Pompeo said, referring to islets, reefs and other land features in the West Philippine Sea being claimed by China.</p><p>&ldquo;In line with the Tribunal&rsquo;s legally binding decision, the PRC has no lawful territorial or maritime claim to Mischief (Panganiban) Reef or Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal, both of which fall fully under the Philippines&rsquo; sovereign rights and jurisdiction, nor does Beijing have any territorial or maritime claims generated from these features,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He also said Beijing has no lawful, coherent maritime claim over areas within the territorial waters of other countries in the region like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.</p><p>&ldquo;As such, the United States rejects any PRC maritime claim in the waters surrounding Vanguard Bank (off Vietnam), Luconia Shoals (off Malaysia), waters in Brunei&rsquo;s EEZ and Natuna Besar (off Indonesia),&rdquo; Pompeo said. &ldquo;Any PRC action to harass other states&rsquo; fishing or hydrocarbon development in these waters &ndash; or to carry out such activities unilaterally &ndash; is unlawful.&rdquo;</p><p>Pompeo also noted that China has no lawful territorial or maritime claim over James Shoal, an entirely submerged feature only 50 nautical miles from Malaysia and some 1,000 nautical miles from China&rsquo;s coast. James Shoal is often cited in China&rsquo;s propaganda as the &ldquo;southernmost territory of China.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;International law is clear: An underwater feature like James Shoal cannot be claimed by any state and is incapable of generating maritime zones. James Shoal (roughly 20 meters below the surface) is not and never was PRC territory, nor can Beijing assert any lawful maritime rights from it,&rdquo; Pompeo stressed.</p><p>Responding to Pompeo&rsquo;s statement, China said the US &ldquo;deliberately distorts the facts and international law,&rdquo; including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p><p>&ldquo;The United States is not a country directly involved in the disputes. However, it has kept interfering in the issue. Under the pretext of preserving stability, it is flexing muscles, stirring up tension and inciting confrontation in the region,&rdquo; the Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement.</p><p>&ldquo;We advise the US side to earnestly honor its commitment of not taking sides on the issue of territorial sovereignty, respect regional countries&rsquo; efforts for a peaceful and stable South China Sea and stop its attempts to disrupt and sabotage regional peace and stability,&rdquo; the embassy said.</p>

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Most hospitals in Metro Manila, Cebu City and Iloilo have almost reached their full bed capacity for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, according to the&amp;nbsp;Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines Inc.

PHAPi president Rustico Jimenez said there is a need to decongest hospitals of patients who can be transferred to quarantine facilities, but do not want to.

&amp;ldquo;These areas have the highest number of cases and are nearing their full capacity.&amp;nbsp;Other areas are still manageable, unless the cases will continue to surge,&amp;rdquo; Jimenez told The STAR.

Jimenez said there is an immediate need to decongest hospitals by transferring patients who have recovered to step-down quarantine facilities.

He said those who are asymptomatic and have mild symptoms should be placed in isolation centers and not in hospitals.

Jimenez said hospitals are having difficulty transferring patients to isolation facilities as most of them refuse to do so.

&amp;ldquo;We need the help of government in transferring patients to decongest the hospitals and make space for those who are severe and critical,&amp;rdquo; he said.

As this developed, The Medical City (TMC) announced that it has reached its full bed capacity for COVID-19 patients despite&amp;nbsp;efforts to re-organize and augment its facilities and manpower.

Earlier, St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center in Quezon City and Bonifacio Global City in Taguig as well as the Makati Medical Center announced that their bed capacity for COVID cases were full.

&amp;ldquo;We are aware that this is a looming problem, but we cannot go beyond our capacity to take care of COVID-19 patients without posing serious risks to everyone, both COVID and non-COVID patients as well as our hospital staff,&amp;rdquo; read a statement signed by TMC chief medical officer Rafael Claudio.

He said TMC does not wish to compromise its service to general patients, who have less serious medical needs and now comprise a majority of the hospital&amp;rsquo;s case load.

The hospital appealed for understanding as it advised the public to consider other institutions for critically-ill COVID-19 patients.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;ldquo;We are coordinating with the city government of Pasig for the management of COVID-19 patients on the strength of our existing public-private partnership designating Pasig City Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital (PCCH) as a COVID center for &amp;lsquo;moderate&amp;rsquo; cases. We are ready to facilitate endorsement if and when we can,&amp;rdquo; Claudio said.

He gave assurance that TMC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;quality of care remains uncompromised&amp;rdquo; as it continues to address the situation.

&amp;ldquo;We empathize with COVID patients, but we are just as committed to provide quality services and secure the facilities strictly allocated for non-COVID cases, which remain open. Their health needs are just as urgent and important,&amp;rdquo; he added.

Solidarity calls

Doctors&amp;rsquo; groups yesterday called for solidarity amid the soaring COVID-19 cases, saying the virus&amp;rsquo; threat is real.

The Philippine College of Physicians (PCP), Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Philippine College of Chest Physicians, Philippine Pediatric Society and Philippine Society of Public Health Physicians said the government and citizens should join hands as &amp;ldquo;signs of another surge appear.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;The rise in cases can no longer be explained by increased testing capacity alone. Deaths are rising and hospitals are filling up even as COVID-19 beds are increased,&amp;rdquo; the groups said.

They said the soaring cases have&amp;nbsp;increased the demand on the healthcare workforce that &amp;ldquo;already faces fear, fatigue, anxiety and even stigma.&amp;rdquo;

The groups warned the Philippines &amp;ldquo;may become the next global epicenter of COVID-19 unless prompt action is taken by our leaders and the public.&amp;rdquo;

At a press briefing, PCP vice president Ma. Encarnita Blanco-Limpin said the ballooning number of COVID-19 cases is alarming and real.

&amp;ldquo;The increase in cases is not only because of the expansion of testing, but there is really an increase in the number of people who are getting sick with COVID-19. As doctors, we see that happening in the hospitals,&amp;rdquo; Limpin said.

She said the rising death toll, as shown by the increasing utilization rates of COVID-19 wards in hospitals, is also worrisome as this may entail more deaths among the severe and critical patients.

&amp;lsquo;Fix your system&amp;rsquo;

Militant group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) said the Department of Health (DOH) should fix its system of validation of COVID-19 cases and provide the public with a real picture of the virus transmission.

Latest data from the DOH showed 73,618 people tested positive for COVID-19 as of July 12, but the number of confirmed cases was only 57,006 as of July 13.

Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said there is a huge case validation backlog of 16,612 cases.

&amp;ldquo;This means that the actual number of COVID cases is much higher than what is being reported. We are not being given the true picture of COVID-19 transmission in the country. This disturbing development comes amid several public and private hospitals announcing that they have reached full bed capacity for COVID-19 patients,&amp;rdquo; Reyes said.

&amp;ldquo;The government failed to emphasize the 7.9 percent cumulative positivity rate, which continues to rise and is above the recommended five percent rate by the World Health Organization,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Reyes said there were only 17,065 tests done on July 12 involving 16,042 individuals. &amp;ldquo;This is way below the target of 30,000 tests per day and the so-called 51,000 daily testing capacity. Testing backlog for this day reached 15,121,&amp;rdquo; he said, adding that the public deserves to know the true extent of infection.

&amp;ldquo;This can only be done through aggressive testing and by fixing the backlog in validation,&amp;rdquo; the group said. Neil Jayson Servallos, Rhodina Villanueva

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; President Duterte&amp;nbsp;on Monday boasted about successfully fighting oligarchs head-on without the need to impose military rule.

&amp;ldquo;Without declaring martial law, sinira ko &amp;rsquo;yung mga tao na humahawak sa ekonomiya at umiipit at hindi nagbabayad (I destroyed people who control the economy, oppress and do not pay taxes),&amp;rdquo; Duterte said in his speech before soldiers during a clandestine visit to Kuta General Teodulfo Bautista in Jolo, Sulu.

The government-run stations aired the edited and shortened version of the President&amp;rsquo;s speech only on Tuesday morning.

Although the President did not say it directly, he subtly compared his actions to the time of the late former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who imposed martial law from 1972 to 1986 and seized major corporations, including television network ABS-CBN.

Unlike Marcos, Duterte said he&amp;nbsp;did&amp;nbsp;not need to impose martial rule over certain businesses held allegedly by the country&amp;rsquo;s oligarchs.

&amp;ldquo;They take advantage sa kanilang (of their) political power,&amp;rdquo; Duterte said during his talk with the troops.

The Chief Executive also addressed Gov. Abdusakur Tan, who celebrated his birthday on Monday, to explain how some influential people supposedly chart the fate of candidates during elections.

&amp;ldquo;Ganoon &amp;rsquo;yan, Sakur, ganoon &amp;rsquo;yan. Every election noon o sa ngayon o bukas, sabihin nila sa isang kuwarto lang &amp;rsquo;yan, &amp;lsquo;O padre, sinong kandidato natin ngayon? O ikaw diyan, ikaw ang bahala sa ano ha, you raise the funds&amp;rsquo; (That&amp;rsquo;s how it is, Sakur, that&amp;rsquo;s how it is. Every election then or now or tomorrow, they meet in a room, choose their candidates and raise the funds),&amp;rdquo; Duterte said.

Since the government only aired portions of the President&amp;rsquo;s speech, it was not known whether he named the oligarchs he referred to.&amp;nbsp;He felt &amp;ldquo;so much pain,&amp;rdquo; however, on how these people supposedly &amp;ldquo;played the nation.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Lima &amp;rsquo;ata lang ang tao. Isang pamilya lang ang nag-uusap diyan. Ganun nilaro nila ang bayan ko (It&amp;rsquo;s just five persons, I think. Only one family talking in there. That&amp;rsquo;s how they played my nation),&amp;rdquo; he lamented.

Proud about exacting accountability from oligarchs,&amp;nbsp;Duterte said he would die happy knowing he has done his part in making sure that he was able to address the issues involving these people with vested self-interests.

&amp;ldquo;Kaya ako mamatay, mahulog &amp;rsquo;yung eroplano, p***** i** (That&amp;rsquo;s why, if I die, if my plane would crash), I am very happy. Alam mo bakit (You know why)? Sabi ko (I said), without declaring martial law, I dismantled the oligarchy that controlled the economy of the Filipino people,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Not ABS-CBN

Sought for clarification on the President&amp;rsquo;s statement later in the day, presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said the Duterte was not referring to ABS-CBN.

Roque said the Chief Executive was talking about his usual pet peeves: the Ayalas, Pangilinan Group&amp;nbsp;and Lucio Tan.

The Palace spokesman said the President&amp;rsquo;s statement had nothing to do with ABS-CBN&amp;rsquo;s closure at all.

At a virtual press briefing at Malaca&amp;ntilde;ang,&amp;nbsp;Roque agreed to a reporter&amp;rsquo;s query if Duterte&amp;rsquo;s statement came as a coincidence with the denial of the ABS-CBN&amp;rsquo;s franchise.

&amp;ldquo;I believe so, because he always mentions in his speeches the oligarchs that he himself really destroyed,&amp;rdquo; Roque said in mixed English and Filipino.

&amp;ldquo;The case of ABS-CBN is a case of an expired franchise which was not renewed by Congress,&amp;rdquo; he added.

What crony?

Roque also dismissed insinuations that Duterte has his own cronies even as he relentlessly attacked water concessionaires and major telecommunication companies as well as major news outfits critical of his administration.

The presidential spokesman defended Davao-based businessman Dennis Uy, whose businesses range from pertroleum to digital start-up, casino franchise, a bakery chain, car dealership and water utility, among others.

&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s none because Dennis Uy&amp;hellip; They built their fortune because of mining and coal in Diwalwal. So no one can doubt that Diwalwal is gold-producing,&amp;rdquo; Roque said.

&amp;ldquo;So, let&amp;rsquo;s not think that (Uy&amp;rsquo;s) wealth was because of President Duterte. He&amp;rsquo;s been wealthy for long,&amp;rdquo; he added.

Fighting the corrupt, abusive

As Sen. Bong Go understands it, the President was not pertaining to any specific case but was talking about the impact of the administration&amp;rsquo;s continuing fight against corruption in his address to the military.

&amp;ldquo;He did not say who, anyway, but he was stressing that in the past years that we&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting the corrupt and abusive, it just so happened that the truth about the mismanagement of some groups or companies in the country emerged,&amp;rdquo; Go said in Filipino.

&amp;ldquo;We won&amp;rsquo;t let this pass unaddressed and we will make sure that wrongdoings are fixed so that we can finally eradicate corruption and abusive practices. Because of this fight, the oligarchy system in the country is dismantled little by little, without the need to declare martial law,&amp;rdquo; he added.

This fight against corruption and abusive practices stems from the President&amp;rsquo;s love for the country, according to the senator.

&amp;ldquo;I will continue to support the President in this fight in order to rid our country of corruption from top to bottom. If you love your country, you will defend it from all abusers, from the smallest to the most powerful, who do harm to our fellow Filipinos,&amp;rdquo; Go said.

&amp;ldquo;That is why when oligarchs, terrorists, criminals and abusive or corrupt officials try to harm or take advantage of the people, in the eyes of the President, they are the enemies who threaten our democratic way of life and he will not hesitate to fight them to protect the interests of the ordinary Filipinos,&amp;rdquo; he added.

Fabricated problem

For Sen. Francis Pangilinan, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hunger and loss of jobs are the urgent problems that confront millions of Filipinos now and not the so-called oligarchs.

Pangilinan was responding to media queries on his reaction to Duterte&amp;rsquo;s address to soldiers in Sulu that he has &amp;ldquo;dismantled&amp;rdquo; the oligarchy without declaring martial law.

The senator asserted that the &amp;ldquo;oligarchy problem&amp;rdquo; was just fabricated to cover up the government&amp;rsquo;s dismal response in battling the pandemic and its ill effects, causing suffering among millions of Filipinos.

&amp;ldquo;The problem on so-called oligarchs was just made up. The closure of ABS-CBN does not have anything to do with addressing COVID-19. The problem on oligarchs was just trumped up to mislead people because to be honest, they have nothing to show &amp;ndash; not even a little good result in fighting COVID-19, hunger and the loss of jobs of millions of our countrymen,&amp;rdquo; he said.

On Monday, the Department of Health reported the biggest single-day jump in COVID-19 deaths in the country at 162 new fatalities. The DOH warned of further infections and fatalities unless &amp;ldquo;the people learn to live with the virus.&amp;rdquo;

As of Monday also, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country was recorded at 57,006, second only to Indonesia, which has the highest figure in Southeast Asia.

A total of 1,599 deaths and 20,371 recoveries have so far been reported in the Philippines.

The total number of coronavirus infections has more than tripled since June 1 when the government began easing stringent lockdown measures to restart the economy.

Sen. Joel Villanueva said institutional and legal arrangements that do not facilitate enough competition to challenge the market control of the few are to blame for oligarchy in the country.

&amp;ldquo;To equate the non-renewal of ABS-CBN to the dismantling of oligarchy is inaccurate. It has more negative effects on the economy and the business climate,&amp;rdquo; Villanueva said.

&amp;ldquo;To deny the franchise of a company which has no clear violations of our laws sends a signal that politicians can stop a business operation on a whim. This is not a conducive climate for investment and therefore contrary to public welfare,&amp;rdquo; he added.&amp;nbsp; Cecille Suerte Felipe Paolo Romero, Edu Punay, Evelyn Macairan, Jose Rodel Clapano

                <![CDATA[<p>MANILA, Philippines &mdash; President Duterte&nbsp;on Monday boasted about successfully fighting oligarchs head-on without the need to impose military rule.</p><p>&ldquo;Without declaring martial law, sinira ko &rsquo;yung mga tao na humahawak sa ekonomiya at umiipit at hindi nagbabayad (I destroyed people who control the economy, oppress and do not pay taxes),&rdquo; Duterte said in his speech before soldiers during a clandestine visit to Kuta General Teodulfo Bautista in Jolo, Sulu.</p><p>The government-run stations aired the edited and shortened version of the President&rsquo;s speech only on Tuesday morning.</p><p>Although the President did not say it directly, he subtly compared his actions to the time of the late former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who imposed martial law from 1972 to 1986 and seized major corporations, including television network ABS-CBN.</p><p>Unlike Marcos, Duterte said he&nbsp;did&nbsp;not need to impose martial rule over certain businesses held allegedly by the country&rsquo;s oligarchs.</p><p>&ldquo;They take advantage sa kanilang (of their) political power,&rdquo; Duterte said during his talk with the troops.</p><p>The Chief Executive also addressed Gov. Abdusakur Tan, who celebrated his birthday on Monday, to explain how some influential people supposedly chart the fate of candidates during elections.</p><p>&ldquo;Ganoon &rsquo;yan, Sakur, ganoon &rsquo;yan. Every election noon o sa ngayon o bukas, sabihin nila sa isang kuwarto lang &rsquo;yan, &lsquo;O padre, sinong kandidato natin ngayon? O ikaw diyan, ikaw ang bahala sa ano ha, you raise the funds&rsquo; (That&rsquo;s how it is, Sakur, that&rsquo;s how it is. Every election then or now or tomorrow, they meet in a room, choose their candidates and raise the funds),&rdquo; Duterte said.</p><p>Since the government only aired portions of the President&rsquo;s speech, it was not known whether he named the oligarchs he referred to.&nbsp;He felt &ldquo;so much pain,&rdquo; however, on how these people supposedly &ldquo;played the nation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lima &rsquo;ata lang ang tao. Isang pamilya lang ang nag-uusap diyan. Ganun nilaro nila ang bayan ko (It&rsquo;s just five persons, I think. Only one family talking in there. That&rsquo;s how they played my nation),&rdquo; he lamented.</p><p>Proud about exacting accountability from oligarchs,&nbsp;Duterte said he would die happy knowing he has done his part in making sure that he was able to address the issues involving these people with vested self-interests.</p><p>&ldquo;Kaya ako mamatay, mahulog &rsquo;yung eroplano, p***** i** (That&rsquo;s why, if I die, if my plane would crash), I am very happy. Alam mo bakit (You know why)? Sabi ko (I said), without declaring martial law, I dismantled the oligarchy that controlled the economy of the Filipino people,&rdquo; he said.</p><h2><strong>Not ABS-CBN</strong></h2><p>Sought for clarification on the President&rsquo;s statement later in the day, presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said the Duterte was not referring to ABS-CBN.</p><p>Roque said the Chief Executive was talking about his usual pet peeves: the Ayalas, Pangilinan Group&nbsp;and Lucio Tan.</p><p>The Palace spokesman said the President&rsquo;s statement had nothing to do with ABS-CBN&rsquo;s closure at all.</p><p>At a virtual press briefing at Malaca&ntilde;ang,&nbsp;Roque agreed to a reporter&rsquo;s query if Duterte&rsquo;s statement came as a coincidence with the denial of the ABS-CBN&rsquo;s franchise.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe so, because he always mentions in his speeches the oligarchs that he himself really destroyed,&rdquo; Roque said in mixed English and Filipino.</p><p>&ldquo;The case of ABS-CBN is a case of an expired franchise which was not renewed by Congress,&rdquo; he added.</p><h2><strong>What crony?</strong></h2><p>Roque also dismissed insinuations that Duterte has his own cronies even as he relentlessly attacked water concessionaires and major telecommunication companies as well as major news outfits critical of his administration.</p><p>The presidential spokesman defended Davao-based businessman Dennis Uy, whose businesses range from pertroleum to digital start-up, casino franchise, a bakery chain, car dealership and water utility, among others.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none because Dennis Uy&hellip; They built their fortune because of mining and coal in Diwalwal. So no one can doubt that Diwalwal is gold-producing,&rdquo; Roque said.</p><p>&ldquo;So, let&rsquo;s not think that (Uy&rsquo;s) wealth was because of President Duterte. He&rsquo;s been wealthy for long,&rdquo; he added.</p><h2><strong>Fighting the corrupt, abusive</strong></h2><p>As Sen. Bong Go understands it, the President was not pertaining to any specific case but was talking about the impact of the administration&rsquo;s continuing fight against corruption in his address to the military.</p><p>&ldquo;He did not say who, anyway, but he was stressing that in the past years that we&rsquo;ve been fighting the corrupt and abusive, it just so happened that the truth about the mismanagement of some groups or companies in the country emerged,&rdquo; Go said in Filipino.</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let this pass unaddressed and we will make sure that wrongdoings are fixed so that we can finally eradicate corruption and abusive practices. Because of this fight, the oligarchy system in the country is dismantled little by little, without the need to declare martial law,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>This fight against corruption and abusive practices stems from the President&rsquo;s love for the country, according to the senator.</p><p>&ldquo;I will continue to support the President in this fight in order to rid our country of corruption from top to bottom. If you love your country, you will defend it from all abusers, from the smallest to the most powerful, who do harm to our fellow Filipinos,&rdquo; Go said.</p><p>&ldquo;That is why when oligarchs, terrorists, criminals and abusive or corrupt officials try to harm or take advantage of the people, in the eyes of the President, they are the enemies who threaten our democratic way of life and he will not hesitate to fight them to protect the interests of the ordinary Filipinos,&rdquo; he added.</p><h2><strong>Fabricated problem</strong></h2><p>For Sen. Francis Pangilinan, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hunger and loss of jobs are the urgent problems that confront millions of Filipinos now and not the so-called oligarchs.</p><p>Pangilinan was responding to media queries on his reaction to Duterte&rsquo;s address to soldiers in Sulu that he has &ldquo;dismantled&rdquo; the oligarchy without declaring martial law.</p><p>The senator asserted that the &ldquo;oligarchy problem&rdquo; was just fabricated to cover up the government&rsquo;s dismal response in battling the pandemic and its ill effects, causing suffering among millions of Filipinos.</p><p>&ldquo;The problem on so-called oligarchs was just made up. The closure of ABS-CBN does not have anything to do with addressing COVID-19. The problem on oligarchs was just trumped up to mislead people because to be honest, they have nothing to show &ndash; not even a little good result in fighting COVID-19, hunger and the loss of jobs of millions of our countrymen,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>On Monday, the Department of Health reported the biggest single-day jump in COVID-19 deaths in the country at 162 new fatalities. The DOH warned of further infections and fatalities unless &ldquo;the people learn to live with the virus.&rdquo;</p><p>As of Monday also, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country was recorded at 57,006, second only to Indonesia, which has the highest figure in Southeast Asia.</p><p>A total of 1,599 deaths and 20,371 recoveries have so far been reported in the Philippines.</p><p>The total number of coronavirus infections has more than tripled since June 1 when the government began easing stringent lockdown measures to restart the economy.</p><p>Sen. Joel Villanueva said institutional and legal arrangements that do not facilitate enough competition to challenge the market control of the few are to blame for oligarchy in the country.</p><p>&ldquo;To equate the non-renewal of ABS-CBN to the dismantling of oligarchy is inaccurate. It has more negative effects on the economy and the business climate,&rdquo; Villanueva said.</p><p>&ldquo;To deny the franchise of a company which has no clear violations of our laws sends a signal that politicians can stop a business operation on a whim. This is not a conducive climate for investment and therefore contrary to public welfare,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; <strong>Cecille Suerte Felipe Paolo Romero, Edu Punay, Evelyn Macairan, Jose Rodel Clapano</strong></p><p><strong>Related video:</strong></p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/msaHOIjf0jE" width="100%"></iframe></p>

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Parents have until today to enroll their children in public schools for the upcoming school year that would begin on Aug. 24, the Department of Education (DepEd) said yesterday.

Public school students may be enrolled remotely through text message, phone call or social media or through designated drop boxes in schools or barangay halls, according to DepEd.

As of yesterday, a total of 19,888,067 students have expressed their intent to enroll in public and private schools next school year, which is expected to forgo face-to-face classes due to the pandemic.

More than 18.8 million students have enrolled in public schools. Private schools only have a little over a million enrollees so far.

The DepEd said the total number of enrollees accounts for 71 percent of the more than 27 million students in basic education last year and 90.5 percent of the projected 21.97 million enrollment next school year.

Education officials earlier said enrollment would drop by around 20 percent or at least six million due to the economic impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic.

&amp;ldquo;We expect that we would not reach 27 million. We have a different projection,&amp;rdquo; Education Secretary Leonor Briones has said.

&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re having negative economic growth this year and probably the following year based on projections. That is a big thing,&amp;rdquo; she said.

Based on the latest DepEd data, enrollment in public schools represents 83.4 percent of last year while private school enrollment is only at 23.6 percent.

Over 250,000 students have transferred to public schools, the DepEd said.

Briones earlier said the number of enrollees in private schools might still increase given the different enrollment schedules.

Private school organizations have expressed alarm over the drop in enrollment.

Cash aid for teachers

Leaders of the House of Representatives are considering covering private school teachers and personnel in financial aid under the proposed Bayanihan to Recover as One Act or Bayanihan 2.

Like low-income families, Deputy Speaker and 1 Pacman party-list Rep. Mikee Romero said private school personnel should receive financial assistance of up to P8,000, which was granted by the government under the Bayanihan 1 Law.

&amp;ldquo;We should have one-time assistance for employees in private schools who, like most of our workers, have been affected by the pandemic,&amp;rdquo; Romero said.

&amp;ldquo;We can categorize them as low-income and include the same amount of aid for them in Bayanihan 2, depending on the regions where they live,&amp;rdquo; he added.

Romero pointed out that private school teachers would continue to be without income until classes open in August.

He suggested that private school employees who received cash assistance under Bayanihan 1 would no longer get additional aid if Congress includes such aid in Bayanihan 2.

Medical reserve corps bill

Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker LRay Villafuerte has proposed the creation of a medical reserve corps to better prepare the country&amp;rsquo;s healthcare system for future pandemics.

Villafuerte recently filed House Bill 7007, which seeks to tap graduates with degrees in the fields of medicine, nursing, medical technology and other related courses who have not yet secured licenses, to augment frontliners during national health emergencies and disasters.

He said the medical reserve corps may be called upon and mobilized to assist the national and local governments in addressing the urgent needs of the country&amp;rsquo;s healthcare system.

Several lawmakers have expressed support for Villafuerte&amp;rsquo;s measure, which is similar to a bill filed by Sen. Pia Cayetano in the Senate.

Villafuerte cited the lack of medical personnel during the initial stages of the country&amp;rsquo;s fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the measure, the health secretary will initiate the mobilization of the medical reserve corps in coordination with the secretaries of the Departments of National Defense, Education and the Interior and Local Government or their duly authorized representatives with a rank of undersecretary.

                <![CDATA[I stopped counting and trying to identify when I got to 50. I mean those old songs served up in the soundtrack of the new Netflix series Hollywood. There might be more but it will need another seating to fully check out and to once more enjoy this sumptuous feast of sight, sounds and strange emotions.

Now, the use of old songs in films is nothing new. It is a very effective way of providing just the right ambience, moving the story and for enhancing performances. But Hollywood does it differently. The scenes play out through the songs. Maybe this is because the songs are the only things real in the show.

Set during the period right after World War II, the series offers a look at what is believed to be the Golden Age of the motion picture industry. Because of the perceived glamor and easy money that come with jobs in the movie business, there were a lot of young people, talented or not, who decided to try their luck in the fabled place where dreams come true.&amp;nbsp; And they will do anything to succeed.

The pitch is nothing new but note that this Hollywood is produced by Ryan Murphy partnered this time around with Ian Brennan. There is just no way that it can be anything but edgy, extraordinary. Murphy is one of today&amp;rsquo;s hottest producers. We loved his musical sitcom Glee. He cast Lady Gaga in American Horror Story and turned her into an award-winning actress. And we were riveted in front of the screen watching Billie Porter in Pose.

Hollywood is a story of dreams and what-ifs. It is billed as an alternate history where fiction blends with real-life in an aspirational tale about surmounting biases about gender, race and sexuality. It says this is what might have happened if only&amp;hellip;

Watch and be prepared to go &amp;ldquo;Huh!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; or wonder, did that really happen? You will surely end up wondering but also oh-so-content about the hours you spent with this Hollywood.

Murphy&amp;rsquo;s characteristic daring is manifested throughout all seven episodes. Lots of juicy bits. Did Ernie West pimp Rock Hudson? His flair for out-of-the-box but eventually spot-on casting in great evidence. Who would have thought of Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory as the unscrupulous talent agent Harry Wilson. This is the best performance of the batch.

Darren Criss, David Corenswet, Laura Harrier, Dylan McDermott, Jake Pickering, Jeremy Pope, Patti Lupone, Joe Mantello, Holland Taylor and Samantha Weaving lead the stellar cast.&amp;nbsp; Gorgeous sets abound. Costumes are so chic and timeless. And every piece of music played harks back to that time of Hollywood as Dreamland.

Hollywood takes a lot of liberties with history but this is not so with the music. While most shows would opt to use new versions of old songs, this one picked out some of the best and the rarest of the era and used them to excellent effect.

Ella Fitzgerald and the Inkspots open with I&amp;rsquo;m Beginning to See the Light. Frank Sinatra&amp;rsquo;s As Time Goes By plays for a lonely night. Artie Shaw&amp;rsquo;s clarinet plays Begin the Beguine for Dreamland. The Pied Pipers background a striptease with Embraceable You. What about Herbert Von Karajan&amp;rsquo;s Salome&amp;rsquo;s Dance of the Seven Veils for a burlesque number.

Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m Happy by Jo Stafford for a Rock Hudson seduction. Glenn Miller and his Orchestra introduce America&amp;rsquo;s First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt with the King Porter Stomp. And when Hollywood celebrated back then they played There&amp;rsquo;s No Business Like Showbusiness by Ethel Merman.

There are also a lovely You&amp;rsquo;d be So Nice to Come Home To by Dinah Shore; It&amp;rsquo;s a Good Day by Peggy Lee; Sing, Sing, Sing by Benny Goodman and his Orchestra; Paper Doll by the Mills Brothers; Just Imagine by Doris Day; Friendship by Judy Garland; plus many others including Catch a Falling Star by Perry Como which was actually recorded in the late &amp;lsquo;50s but says so much about the lead character Jack&amp;rsquo;s showbiz career.

It says this is what might have happened if only&hellip;</p><p>Watch and be prepared to go &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; or &ldquo;What?&rdquo; or wonder, did that really happen? You will surely end up wondering but also oh-so-content about the hours you spent with this Hollywood.</p><p>Murphy&rsquo;s characteristic daring is manifested throughout all seven episodes. Lots of juicy bits. Did Ernie West pimp Rock Hudson? His flair for out-of-the-box but eventually spot-on casting in great evidence. Who would have thought of Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory as the unscrupulous talent agent Harry Wilson. This is the best performance of the batch.</p><p>Darren Criss, David Corenswet, Laura Harrier, Dylan McDermott, Jake Pickering, Jeremy Pope, Patti Lupone, Joe Mantello, Holland Taylor and Samantha Weaving lead the stellar cast.&nbsp; Gorgeous sets abound. Costumes are so chic and timeless. And every piece of music played harks back to that time of Hollywood as Dreamland.</p><p>Hollywood takes a lot of liberties with history but this is not so with the music. While most shows would opt to use new versions of old songs, this one picked out some of the best and the rarest of the era and used them to excellent effect.</p><p>Ella Fitzgerald and the Inkspots open with I&rsquo;m Beginning to See the Light. Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s As Time Goes By plays for a lonely night. Artie Shaw&rsquo;s clarinet plays Begin the Beguine for Dreamland. The Pied Pipers background a striptease with Embraceable You. What about Herbert Von Karajan&rsquo;s Salome&rsquo;s Dance of the Seven Veils for a burlesque number.</p><p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m Happy by Jo Stafford for a Rock Hudson seduction. Glenn Miller and his Orchestra introduce America&rsquo;s First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt with the King Porter Stomp. And when Hollywood celebrated back then they played There&rsquo;s No Business Like Showbusiness by Ethel Merman.</p><p>There are also a lovely You&rsquo;d be So Nice to Come Home To by Dinah Shore; It&rsquo;s a Good Day by Peggy Lee; Sing, Sing, Sing by Benny Goodman and his Orchestra; Paper Doll by the Mills Brothers; Just Imagine by Doris Day; Friendship by Judy Garland; plus many others including Catch a Falling Star by Perry Como which was actually recorded in the late &lsquo;50s but says so much about the lead character Jack&rsquo;s showbiz career.</p>

                <![CDATA[Kapuso host Winnie Monsod takes on the new normal in television work with a &amp;ldquo;survival guide&amp;rdquo; for viewers to stay informed, safe and well amid the fake news this time of COVID-19.

Mareng Winnie, as she&amp;rsquo;s fondly called, hosts Newsmakers, one of the new shows under the banner New Normal: The Survival Guide, to be launched on the week of July 20 on GMA News TV, from Mondays to Fridays, 8:30 p.m. after the 24 Oras simulcast. Described as GMA News TV&amp;rsquo;s first daily magazine program conceptualized with the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; in mind, the week-long line-up hopes to somehow help viewers &amp;ldquo;navigate this new way of living through information and practical solutions.&amp;rdquo;



The Bawal Ang Pasaway host does the Newsmakers every Monday, starting off the week with a lowdown on the hottest issues and interviews with people in the headlines via online video-conferencing.

&amp;ldquo;You know, in the new normal, it is even more important that we have proper information, not false information&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do in this show. We talk to the experts, and I want them to tell it straight. In the few shows that we taped already, it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s doing alright,&amp;rdquo; she told a select media over a Zoom interview, where she was joined by Kara David and Susan Enriquez, hosts of the other New Normal shows Bright Side (Tuesdays) and Pera Paraan (Wednesdays), respectively.

But it&amp;rsquo;s not all serious, Mareng Winnie noted, there&amp;rsquo;s also fun with her take on viral videos, trends and apps such as Netflix, Tiktok, online courier services, among other things that used to be alien to her as a senior citizen.

Aside from teaching herself to be more tech-savvy, The STAR asked the Economics professor and opinion columnist if she has (re)discovered any survival skills during the quarantine period.

Mareng Winnie said, &amp;ldquo;I rediscovered that I could fix my house pala,&amp;rdquo;pointing out the background of what appeared to be the study room of her Metro Manila home. &amp;ldquo;Before, this place was a black hole! Full of papers, etc., etc. All my shoes were out there. Really! COVID allowed me to fix my study.&amp;rdquo;

She continued, &amp;ldquo;I fixed my bathroom because my bathroom and sink, hindi ko na nagagamit kasi punong-puno with so many things. I fixed the faucet. My goodness! You know, there are good things that happened to people who work like that.&amp;rdquo;

The biggest surprise though was discovering money while decluttering.

&amp;ldquo;Aba, nakakita ako ng P10,000 sa isang lugar. Nakakita ako ng $650 anduduon sa likod,&amp;rdquo; she revealed. &amp;ldquo;And that&amp;rsquo;s not all! Because I&amp;rsquo;m fixing all, all, all my drawers. All! And then, I found P25,000. But the best (was) in my own drawer, where you have your underwear and all that. I made halungkat. I found a thousand dollars! Sabi ko sa kanila, ang sweldo ko for cleaning house. Hindi ba nakaka-inspire &amp;lsquo;yun (laughs)?&amp;rdquo;

In reaction, Kara jokingly offered to clean her house while Susan said it reminded her of the &amp;lsquo;80s sitcom John En Marsha, where John (played by the late comedy king Dolphy) had a rich mother-in-law who&amp;rsquo;d instruct a househelp to just sweep peso bills off the floor every time the family needed money.

Mareng Winnie, on the other hand, said she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know where the money came from but she&amp;rsquo;s certainly happy with her find that amounted to over P100,000 in total. &amp;ldquo;When I told my children about it, inggit na inggit sila. Sabi nila, &amp;lsquo;Mommy, you should have done this before.&amp;rsquo; I said, &amp;lsquo;If I had done this before, I will not have anything now,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; she said, further musing that during this quarantine period, &amp;ldquo;I became a better wife and better housekeeper!&amp;rdquo;

She was also asked how she finds the new normal of mounting a news and public affairs show. Breaking into a wide smile, she exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;Ay naku! I actually love the new normal! Hindi na mini-make-up, hair and all. It is so lovely, I just put powder... What can you do?&amp;rdquo;

According to her, the challenging part is the multi-tasking. &amp;ldquo;The one thing that is problematic to us, is that here I am, I&amp;rsquo;m the host so I&amp;rsquo;m zooming and then we have the producer and the director. They have to phone their own staff, take out their own equipment, bring in their own staff, naaawa ako sa kanila because there are only two of them.

&amp;ldquo;I told them, pwede ba make it three so that somebody else can help you. Because in the normal course of events, there&amp;rsquo;s 20 of you in the room, now all of a sudden you&amp;rsquo;re three... Then tuloy-tuloy, nobody&amp;rsquo;s looking at me because everybody&amp;rsquo;s already doing everything. But all in all, it&amp;rsquo;s a better way of doing things.&amp;rdquo;

As for how she&amp;rsquo;s handling the tech aspects of Newsmakers and navigating through apps like Zoom for interviews, she said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m old but I&amp;rsquo;m not that old (drawing laughter)!&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;I have been zooming for our anniversary, zoom for this birthday, zoom for that birthday. Namatay &amp;lsquo;yung isa, zoom naman, zoom-zoom. So, I am very familiar with Zoom and I think it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic! I mean here you are and you&amp;rsquo;re in all different parts of the world and you&amp;rsquo;re watching each other on the same day at the same time.&amp;rdquo;

If anything, this is a &amp;ldquo;plus side&amp;rdquo; amid the pandemic. Mareng Winnie said, &amp;ldquo;This is the good part, the plus side of the new normal (brought about by COVID-19). I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it&amp;rsquo;s gonna happen. Can you imagine you are watching the Pope (Francis) when he is saying Mass the same time he is saying Mass? Wow! Talagang more than this I cannot ask for.&amp;rdquo;

(Other New Normal: The Survival Guide shows are Home Work on Thursdays, hosted by Tonipet Gaba and Rovilson Fernandez; and Family Time on Fridays by Drew Arellano, beginning July 20 on GMA News TV.)

                <![CDATA[I&amp;rsquo;ll make you laugh when you&amp;rsquo;re blue

That way I can be close to you...

That&amp;rsquo;s the part I must play

That&amp;rsquo;s the way of a clown

Contrary to the message of the Teddy Randazzo song, the clowns are not laughing these days, they are not making us laugh even when we are all feeling blue. They are weeping, their tears rolling down their cheeks like droplets of dreary dew sans sparkle. The reason? The curtain has just fallen on Zirkoh and Klownz, the showcases of their make-you-laugh antics and source of living.

&amp;ldquo;I have no choice,&amp;rdquo; said Allan K, owner-manager of the two comedy bars. &amp;ldquo;It has been almost four months since the ECQ (Enhanced Community Quarantine) was imposed so we have no income pero tuloy-tuloy ang renta ng lugar. No operation, no money, so I decided to close the business.&amp;rdquo;



Both located in Quezon City, Zirkoh (on Timog Avenue) had 40 employees and Klownz (on Quezon Avenue) had 37, all of them provided for by owner Allan K who has declared bankruptcy. Zirkoh was opened in 2004 and Klownz in 2002.



Toeing the DOLE guidelines, Allan notified his employees about his decision (&amp;ldquo;That we were going bankrupt&amp;rdquo;) through letters since they couldn&amp;rsquo;t meet personally because of the &amp;ldquo;social distancing&amp;rdquo; protocol. &amp;ldquo;I took care of my employees; inalagaan ko naman sila. Tanggap nila ang sitwasyon. They understand.&amp;rdquo;

Both located in Quezon City, Zirkoh (on Timog Avenue) has 40 employees and Klownz (on Quezon Avenue) has 37, all of them provided for, and that&amp;rsquo;s not counting the 30-plus entertainers (including Eat, Bulaga! regulars Wally Bayola and Jose Manalo, Ate Gay, Boobay, Beki Belo and Boobsie) who alternated around the nightly slots. Klownz was put up in 2002 and Zirkoh in 2004.



&amp;ldquo;Mga baby ko ang mga &amp;lsquo;yan kaya mabigat sa loob ko ang pagsasara nila,&amp;rdquo; Allan admitted.

The letter &amp;ldquo;K&amp;rdquo; is highlighted in the neon signs of both venues and it stands for, you guessed it, Kilantang which is Allan&amp;rsquo;s surname.

&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s actually spelled Quilantang with a &amp;lsquo;Q,&amp;rsquo; pero it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t sound good if I used &amp;lsquo;Q&amp;rsquo; kasi parang Banana Q ang dating.&amp;rdquo;

The facade of Zirkoh is reminiscent of the old Clover Theater in Sta. Cruz, adorned with colorful circus figures.

&amp;ldquo;That was inspired by the Cirque du Soleil (Circus of the Sun) which I saw at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Ang saya-saya tingnan lalo na pag lighted sa gabi, di ba? Parang maliit na advertisement ng Cirque du Soleil, di ba?&amp;rdquo;



These two pre-pandemic photos were taken from Allan K&amp;rsquo;s Instagram: Business as usual when the crisis is over.



That served as a big come-on for people who trooped to Zirkoh night after night. These days, the facade is dark, unlighted, and the billboard is stark blank when it used to be filled up with performers&amp;rsquo; names during the heyday. The pre-lockdown front parking space is now empty, save for Grab motorbikes waiting for delivery orders from nearby restaurants.

&amp;ldquo;Both bars were the launching pad of aspiring stand-up comedians,&amp;rdquo; noted Allan who was an OFW performer in Japan for three years, coming home and going back six times. &amp;ldquo;Marami ang na-discover sa Zirkoh at Klownz, one of them Boobsie. I saw her in Dubai. I told her, &amp;lsquo;Umuwi ka sa Pilipinas, bibigyan kita ng show.&amp;rsquo; Giving new talents a break makes me really happy.&amp;rdquo;



For almost four months now, Allan has been &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo; in Eat, Bulaga!, his home for 25 years now. A senior, he has been on lockdown like most everybody. Bulaga has resumed airing live but only with Alden Richards, Maine Mendoza, Paolo Ballesteros, Wally Bayola and Jose Manalo in the studio, with Vic Sotto virtually co-hosting from home (with wife Pauleen Luna as camera woman).

&amp;ldquo;I miss our kalokohan,&amp;rdquo; said Allan, &amp;ldquo;and the live studio audience. A few days before the ECQ, we were performing before empty seats and it was sad, nakakalungkot. Now, the audience is people watching at their homes.&amp;rdquo;

On July 29 when Bulaga marks its 41st anniversary, Allan and the other co-hosts (Joey de Leon, Pia Guanio, Ryan Agoncillo, Ruby Rodriguez, Jimmy Santos, Anjo Yllana, Baste and Ryzza Mae Dizon) are expected to return.

In the meantime, Allan is locked down wondering how soon a vaccine or a cure can be found.

&amp;ldquo;Mabangis na virus,&amp;rdquo; he tsk-tsked. &amp;ldquo;Where did it come from? Nagkaroon ng SARS at HIV virus pero never nagka-lockdown. Iba itong virus na &amp;lsquo;to.&amp;rdquo;

His daily routine has been radically changed.

&amp;ldquo;Before the lockdown, after Bulaga, I would take a nap and then dress up to go to Zirkoh and Klownz and stay there until 3 a.m. Back home, hindi ka naman kaagad makakatulog, so 5 a.m. na ang tulog ko. Then, I wake up na to go to Bulaga. Now, bawi-bawi sa tulog.&amp;rdquo;

He has been taking care of his health. He eats brown rice and avoids sweets (his blood sugar is a bit high), and brisk-walks around the village. The norm at home is easy-breezy.

&amp;ldquo;Four months na ako hindi nakakatikim magsuot ng shoes at pants,&amp;rdquo; Allan chuckled. &amp;ldquo;All I wear at home are shorts and sandos, one pair for daytime and another pair at night. Matipid, hahaha!!!&amp;rdquo;

When things get back to normal, when the situation is safe, Allan hopes to reopen his comedy bars.

&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the only business na kaya kong patakbuhin, even with my eyes closed. If somebody asked, &amp;lsquo;Sir, ano ang gagawin dito?&amp;rsquo; Alam ko kung ano ang gagawin.&amp;rdquo;

Okay then where are the clowns? Send in the clowns!!!

Kelly Preston, wife of John Travolta, passes away at 57

Kelly Preston, wife of John Travolta, passed away at 57 last July 12.&amp;nbsp;Preston had been battling cancer the past two years. She grew up in Hawaii and had her first major movie role in Mischief and later appeared in hits Twins, Jerry Maguire and For Love And Honor. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Travolta and Preston were married for more than 28 years. She is survived by daughter Ella, 20, and son Benjamin, 9,&amp;rdquo; said Hollywood-based Filipino designer Oliver Tolentino who did Preston&amp;rsquo;s striking red gown for the 2014 Cannes Film Festival when Travolta was a chair of the AmFar charity gala.

                <![CDATA[<p><em>I&rsquo;ll make you laugh when you&rsquo;re blue</em></p><p><em>That way I can be close to you...</em></p><p><em>That&rsquo;s the part I must play</em></p><p><em>That&rsquo;s the way of a clown</em></p><p>Contrary to the message of the Teddy Randazzo song, the clowns are not laughing these days, they are not making us laugh even when we are all feeling blue. They are weeping, their tears rolling down their cheeks like droplets of dreary dew sans sparkle. The reason? The curtain has just fallen on Zirkoh and Klownz, the showcases of their make-you-laugh antics and source of living.</p><p>&ldquo;I have no choice,&rdquo; said Allan K, owner-manager of the two comedy bars. &ldquo;It has been almost four months since the ECQ (Enhanced Community Quarantine) was imposed so we have no income pero tuloy-tuloy ang renta ng lugar. No operation, no money, so I decided to close the business.&rdquo;</p><div class="captioned_image" style="margin-bottom: 20px"><img alt="" class="full_width" src="https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/entertainment/20200715/ZIRKOH.jpg" style="width: 100%; display: block" /><div class="article_image_caption" style="background-color: gray; font-size: 12px; color: #fff; width: 100%;"><div class="article_image_caption_padding" style="padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 15px;">Both located in Quezon City, Zirkoh (on Timog Avenue) had 40 employees and Klownz (on Quezon Avenue) had 37, all of them provided for by owner Allan K who has declared bankruptcy. Zirkoh was opened in 2004 and Klownz in 2002.</div></div></div><p>Toeing the DOLE guidelines, Allan notified his employees about his decision (&ldquo;That we were going bankrupt&rdquo;) through letters since they couldn&rsquo;t meet personally because of the &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo; protocol. &ldquo;I took care of my employees; inalagaan ko naman sila. Tanggap nila ang sitwasyon. They understand.&rdquo;</p><p>Both located in Quezon City, Zirkoh (on Timog Avenue) has 40 employees and Klownz (on Quezon Avenue) has 37, all of them provided for, and that&rsquo;s not counting the 30-plus entertainers (including Eat, Bulaga! regulars Wally Bayola and Jose Manalo, Ate Gay, Boobay, Beki Belo and Boobsie) who alternated around the nightly slots. Klownz was put up in 2002 and Zirkoh in 2004.</p><p><img alt="" class="full_width" src="https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/entertainment/20200715/LOWNS.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /></p><p>&ldquo;Mga baby ko ang mga &lsquo;yan kaya mabigat sa loob ko ang pagsasara nila,&rdquo; Allan admitted.</p><p>The letter &ldquo;K&rdquo; is highlighted in the neon signs of both venues and it stands for, you guessed it, Kilantang which is Allan&rsquo;s surname.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually spelled Quilantang with a &lsquo;Q,&rsquo; pero it wouldn&rsquo;t sound good if I used &lsquo;Q&rsquo; kasi parang Banana Q ang dating.&rdquo;</p><p>The facade of Zirkoh is reminiscent of the old Clover Theater in Sta. Cruz, adorned with colorful circus figures.</p><p>&ldquo;That was inspired by the Cirque du Soleil (Circus of the Sun) which I saw at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Ang saya-saya tingnan lalo na pag lighted sa gabi, di ba? Parang maliit na advertisement ng Cirque du Soleil, di ba?&rdquo;</p><div class="captioned_image" style="margin-bottom: 20px"><img alt="" class="full_width" src="https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/entertainment/20200715/FLY.jpg" style="width: 100%; display: block" /><div class="article_image_caption" style="background-color: gray; font-size: 12px; color: #fff; width: 100%;"><div class="article_image_caption_padding" style="padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 15px;">These two pre-pandemic photos were taken from Allan K&rsquo;s Instagram: Business as usual when the crisis is over.</div></div></div><p>That served as a big come-on for people who trooped to Zirkoh night after night. These days, the facade is dark, unlighted, and the billboard is stark blank when it used to be filled up with performers&rsquo; names during the heyday. The pre-lockdown front parking space is now empty, save for Grab motorbikes waiting for delivery orders from nearby restaurants.</p><p>&ldquo;Both bars were the launching pad of aspiring stand-up comedians,&rdquo; noted Allan who was an OFW performer in Japan for three years, coming home and going back six times. &ldquo;Marami ang na-discover sa Zirkoh at Klownz, one of them Boobsie. I saw her in Dubai. I told her, &lsquo;Umuwi ka sa Pilipinas, bibigyan kita ng show.&rsquo; Giving new talents a break makes me really happy.&rdquo;</p><p><img alt="" class="full_width" src="https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/entertainment/20200715/IM.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /></p><p>For almost four months now, Allan has been &ldquo;missing&rdquo; in Eat, Bulaga!, his home for 25 years now. A senior, he has been on lockdown like most everybody. Bulaga has resumed airing live but only with Alden Richards, Maine Mendoza, Paolo Ballesteros, Wally Bayola and Jose Manalo in the studio, with Vic Sotto virtually co-hosting from home (with wife Pauleen Luna as camera woman).</p><p>&ldquo;I miss our kalokohan,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;and the live studio audience. A few days before the ECQ, we were performing before empty seats and it was sad, nakakalungkot. Now, the audience is people watching at their homes.&rdquo;</p><p>On July 29 when Bulaga marks its 41st anniversary, Allan and the other co-hosts (Joey de Leon, Pia Guanio, Ryan Agoncillo, Ruby Rodriguez, Jimmy Santos, Anjo Yllana, Baste and Ryzza Mae Dizon) are expected to return.</p><p>In the meantime, Allan is locked down wondering how soon a vaccine or a cure can be found.</p><p>&ldquo;Mabangis na virus,&rdquo; he tsk-tsked. &ldquo;Where did it come from? Nagkaroon ng SARS at HIV virus pero never nagka-lockdown. Iba itong virus na &lsquo;to.&rdquo;</p><p>His daily routine has been radically changed.</p><p>&ldquo;Before the lockdown, after Bulaga, I would take a nap and then dress up to go to Zirkoh and Klownz and stay there until 3 a.m. Back home, hindi ka naman kaagad makakatulog, so 5 a.m. na ang tulog ko. Then, I wake up na to go to Bulaga. Now, bawi-bawi sa tulog.&rdquo;</p><p>He has been taking care of his health. He eats brown rice and avoids sweets (his blood sugar is a bit high), and brisk-walks around the village. The norm at home is easy-breezy.</p><p>&ldquo;Four months na ako hindi nakakatikim magsuot ng shoes at pants,&rdquo; Allan chuckled. &ldquo;All I wear at home are shorts and sandos, one pair for daytime and another pair at night. Matipid, hahaha!!!&rdquo;</p><p>When things get back to normal, when the situation is safe, Allan hopes to reopen his comedy bars.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only business na kaya kong patakbuhin, even with my eyes closed. If somebody asked, &lsquo;Sir, ano ang gagawin dito?&rsquo; Alam ko kung ano ang gagawin.&rdquo;</p><p>Okay then where are the clowns? Send in the clowns!!!</p><div class="captioned_image" style="margin-bottom: 20px"><img alt="" class="full_width" src="https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/entertainment/20200715/GALA-RED.jpg" style="width: 100%; display: block" /><div class="article_image_caption" style="background-color: gray; font-size: 12px; color: #fff; width: 100%;"><div class="article_image_caption_padding" style="padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 15px;">Kelly Preston, wife of John Travolta, passes away at 57.</div></div></div><h2><strong>Kelly Preston, wife of John Travolta, passes away at 57</strong></h2><p>Kelly Preston, wife of John Travolta, passed away at 57 last July 12.&nbsp;Preston had been battling cancer the past two years.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; West zone concessionaire Maynilad Water Services Inc. is set to finish its P7.9-billion La Mesa treatment plants after the government eased quarantine restrictions in the metro.

Maynilad has deployed over 400 workers at La Mesa Treatment Plants 1 and 2 in Quezon City to expedite the completion of the facilities.

The returning workers passed antibody screening tests prior to redeployment, and are now required to follow stricter safety protocols.

&amp;ldquo;Completion of this project is essential to ensuring water service reliability for our customers, given the challenges posed by increasingly variable raw water quality from Angat Dam,&amp;rdquo; Maynilad chief operating officer Randolph Estrellado said.

The P7.9-billion upgrade involves increasing the facilities&amp;rsquo; capacity to treat higher raw water turbidity, retrofitting of structures for improved earthquake resiliency and automating processes.

The two treatment plants produce 2,400 million liters of water per day, and serve around 90 percent of Maynilad&amp;rsquo;s 9.7 million customers.

The upgrade, which started in 2017, is being done in phases so that the facilities can operate without interrupting water services for customers.

Apart from the upgrade of existing treatment facilities, Maynilad&amp;rsquo;s roadmap toward addressing water security challenges include the construction of new treatment facilities, pumping stations and reservoirs, sustained network enhancements through pipe replacements and leak repairs, and development of smaller alternative raw water sources to accommodate a growing population.

Maynilad is the largest private water concessionaire in the country in terms of customer base. It serves the areas of Caloocan, Pasay, Para&amp;ntilde;aque, Las Pi&amp;ntilde;as, Muntinlupa, Valenzuela, Navotas, Malabon, and certain portions of Manila, Quezon City, Makati and Cavite.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; This July 13, Philippine Airlines is launching a mid-year special offer promotion where travelers can &amp;ldquo;enjoy safe skies and safe travels with the Heart of the Filipino&amp;rdquo;.

For base fares as low as P388 for domestic destinations and $99 for international destinations, passengers can book their flights for travels from Aug. 1, up to May 31, 2021.

Whether they are flying home to their loved ones, going on essential business travels, or planning for that long overdue vacation, passengers may avail of these special fares from July 13 to 19.

To avail of the offer, passengers may book via www.philippineairlines.com or call PAL reservations at (+63 2) 8855 &amp;ndash; 8888 or visit any PAL ticketing office or any partner travel agents or through the PAL mobile app.

To ensure the safety and protection of all passengers, PAL is strictly implementing an all-out &amp;lsquo;Fly Safe&amp;rsquo; set of new normal safety measures and practices &amp;ndash; dubbed &amp;ldquo;New Normal, Same Heart&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that adopts international health and safety protocols while keeping the signature heartfelt service that the airline is known for.

Passengers are encouraged to check in online and arrive early at the airport to allocate extra time for new safety procedures. They are also required to wear face masks or facial coverings at all times &amp;ndash; at the airport and throughout the flight &amp;ndash; and observe physical distance whenever queueing in line or while seated at waiting areas at the airport.

The Philippine flag carrier is one of the first in the world to require cabin crew to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) while on board the flight; PAL&amp;rsquo;s cabin crew also undergo medical evaluation prior to their duty. &amp;nbsp;PAL has modified its inflight meal and snack service, using sealed packaging instead of traditional meal arrangements. On top of these, PAL also offers a roomy Business Class as well as onboard distancing seat options in Premium Economy, and a designated zone of the Economy Class cabin for passengers on international flights who wish to have additional comfort and peace of mind when they fly.

All PAL aircraft are equipped with advanced cabin air systems that continuously infuse fresh air across the cabin (cabin air is replaced every two to three minutes), as well as high-efficiency particulate air filters (or HEPA filters) that remove viruses, bacteria and other contaminants with 99.99 percent efficiency. The onboard air creates a controlled and cleaner environment comparable to hospital operating rooms that is safer than most enclosed public spaces.

The flag carrier has partially resumed regular commercial flights to various domestic destinations and key international cities in the US, Asia, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Canada. &amp;nbsp;PAL has also been operating special missions for repatriate stranded Filipinos and foreign nationals to and from different parts of the world, as well as all-cargo services to transport essential supplies across the Philippines and overseas.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Ayala Land Inc., the listed property developer of the Ayala Group, sees the real estate industry recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ayala Land president and CEO Bobby Dy said the country is well positioned to recover from the crisis given its stable macroeconomic fundamentals.

&amp;ldquo;Low interest rates, low inflation rate, and stable exchange rates&amp;mdash;these factors are conducive for investments,&amp;rdquo; Dy said in his opening remarks at a virtual forum held by the Makati Business Club on June 16.

For the property industry, each sector is bound to see different stages of recovery, Dy said.

Ayala Land&amp;rsquo;s office and warehouse logistics units continue to operate without significant effects, while others see different results.

In its residential business, Ayala Land recorded increasing sales from April to May, and again from May to June during the effectivity of enhanced community quarantine.

&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re seeing a pick-up in activity in residential sales as early as now. We hope that positive trend will continue,&amp;rdquo; Dy said.

On the other hand, the company&amp;rsquo;s mall business has especially been affected due to the implementation of quarantine measures since March, prompting consumers to stay at home except for essential needs.

The lockdown measures have also heavily affected the company&amp;rsquo;s hotel and resorts segment, Dy said.

Ayala Land expects travel to recover only when people are once again free to travel.

Amid these impacts, Dy argued that the property industry remains to be one of the best investment options in the country.

&amp;ldquo;If you look at long term trends of property, taking into account various economic cycles, I believe property continues to be one of the best, if not the best, performing asset class,&amp;rdquo; Dy said.

Ayala Land has yet to see a meaningful price correction during the pandemic.

Should there be any, Dy said the company does not expect a repeat of price reductions seen during the Asian Financial Crisis.

There remains to be ample liquidity in the market in search for investment options, he said.

The country&amp;rsquo;s historically low interest rates should also keep asset prices stable.

                <![CDATA[It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that 2020 has been a difficult year for everyone. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single person exempt from the effects of the global pandemic, and so much more that has challenged even basic survival in the past six months. While others are more cushioned by their wealth and privilege there are far too many that are struggling to just get by. I, remember during the ECQ someone said that we are not all in the same boat. We are all in the same storm, but our boats are all very different. Some are luxury yachts, while others are small life rafts barely staying afloat.

After the initial impact hit and several people lost jobs and businesses were going bankrupt and shutting down, there was an urgent call to help uplift one another. People were reminding each other to support local and put their hard-earned money back in the local businesses to help stimulate the economy and get us back on track.

Essentially we were all on survival mode, just trying to make it through. In that aspect, we thought that we should rely on one another to extend a helping hand. If you had to buy food, why not buy, from a local seller? If you need clothes, buy them from local manufacturers and so on. We assumed that as we were all suffering together, we must all have the same mindset &amp;ndash; save money whenever possible and help one another.

Unfortunately, that spirit of bayanihan is beautiful on paper, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t always translate well &amp;ndash; if at all &amp;ndash; in real life. While there were so many doing their part to help, there were others who took advantage of the situation. Some hoarded important items to jack up the prices. Others were hijacking charity efforts for nefarious purposes. Some were quick to anger at small businesses working with a skeleton crew because of very small mistakes. These instances were disheartening.

Recently a story came out about restaurateurs banding together to ask for changes to the benefits systems for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and even senior citizens. It seems that some people are abusing the system and some even using fake credentials for discounts. There was a story about a wealthy family who ordered take out and had their driver pick up the meal, bringing along with him six PWD IDs and requesting for discounts on everything. Every single member of one family had a PWD card? Seems a bit of a stretch to me or, at the very least, a tragic twist of fate.

This shed light on the ongoing struggle some businesses are having due to fake PWD credentials or even people abusing their privileges. Many might think it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal and that no one is getting hurt by them getting a discount on their meals, not having to line up, or being able to park easily. However, in actuality, there are people at the short end of the stick when those with fake PWD cards or those that don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need the privileges, abuse them.

For one, the disbursement of PWD identification in the country is already rather skewed. There are so many persons with disabilities that are not able to get PWD cards because they did not have connections on the inside, while others use these connections to get cards simply for better parking, discounts at expensive restaurants, and the like. Truly deserving differently-abled individuals are denied the privileges they need.

Even if every PWD can get a card, those that abuse the system still cause harm to everyone else. Understandably restaurants and establishments that must provide a discount tend to wary of large groups all presenting cards. Thus, such establishments sometimes adjust their prices accordingly to cover the discount. That makes it more expensive for everyone else. It&amp;rsquo;s because the discount given is not shouldered by the government, but by the establishments. Perhaps if tax exemptions or incentives are given to establishments that offer these discounts are available it would be better, but as is it is the companies have to cover the cost and they aren&amp;rsquo;t in a position to do so right now.

Not to mention jumping the line or taking that parking space right next to the entrance is convenient for some, but can sometimes rob those that really need it &amp;ndash; those that can&amp;rsquo;t walk or are bound to a wheelchairs may often find themselves without a place to park because others that are upwardly mobile have taken the space. I don&amp;rsquo;t discount for one second that there are patients with mental issues that need PWD cards because they will likely be on medication for their entire lives. Discounts on maintenance meds and physician fees are completely understandable. Discernment I guess is what matters when deciding on using these privileges for other things they might not need too.

In the end, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep our minds focused on what is right and just. It is absolutely right that PWDs and senior citizens are given the concessions they deserve. Hopefully, abuses stop so that the system is fair and no one is excluded. At the same time, those who have PWD cards should consider when they need to use them and those that disburse these cards should give them only to those who truly deserve them.

2020 has already been hard enough. Let&amp;rsquo;s move forward into a better normal not just a new normal. If we all work together and uplift, one another, I truly believe we can emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Metro Pacific Tollways Corp. (MPTC) is moving closer to its target of finishing the entire P35.43-billion Cavite-Laguna Expressway (CALAX) project within the term of the current administration as it eyes to open another section of the alignment by the first quarter of next year.

&amp;ldquo;We are hoping that maybe by the end of the year, but possibly first quarter of next year we can open the East Silang Exit. That&amp;rsquo;s the first exit after Laguna,&amp;rdquo; Public Works&amp;nbsp; Secretary Mark Villar said.

&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re targeting to finish the whole alignment within&amp;nbsp; this administration.&amp;nbsp; I think we&amp;rsquo;re well underway,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Roberto Bontia, president of MPTC-unit MPCALA Holdings Inc., said the company is on track to open the new CALAX section by the first quarter of 2021.

He said the company is also working closely with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to complete the entire project within the term of the current administration.

CALAX is designed to be a four-lane, 45.3-kilometer tolled expressway that will connect the Manila-Cavite Expressway in Kawit to South Luzon Expressway at&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mamplasan Interchange in Binan Laguna.

The project will have interchanges in eight locations, namely: Kawit, Daang Hari, Governor&amp;rsquo;s Drive, Aguinaldo Highway, Silang, Sta. Rosa-Tagaytay, Laguna Blvd., Technopark, and a Toll Barrier before SLEX.

The project is divided into two major portions, namely the Cavite segment spanning 27.2 kms and the Laguna segment covering 18.1 kms.

The completion of the entire alignment is expected to cut travel time between Kawit, Cavite and&amp;nbsp; Binan City, Laguna to 45 minutes from the current 90 minutes, making industrial zones, residential areas and tourist destinations around the two provinces more accessible.

Its first 10-km portion between Mamplasan, Binan City and Sta. Rosa&amp;nbsp; was opened to commuters in November last year.

Construction activities for the project were suspended on March 17 due to the enhanced community quarantine, but works resumed on May 25.

The DPWH said overall accomplishment for construction on that Laguna segment is currently at 73 percent.

Last week, MPTC paid the government the second tranche of the concession fees for CALAX amounting to P4.37 billion ahead of its July 10 due date .

The payment is the second of six tranches amounting to P27.3 billion in total concession fees under the 35-year CALAX concession.

MPTC paid the first tranche amounting to P5.46 billion in July 2015.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Sales of imported vehicles accelerated in June as the country transitioned into a more relaxed quarantine phase, but this was not enough to offset a huge drop in total sales during the first six months of the year.

In a report released yesterday, the Association of Vehicle Importers and Distributors Inc. (AVID) said sales in June nearly tripled to 3,697 units from just 1,239 units in May, with demand in all segments (passenger car or PC, commercial vehicle or CV and light commercial vehicle or LCV) growing from nearly three times to four-fold.

AVID sold 1,199 PCs in June, 239 percent higher than the 354 units in May. LCV sales reached 2,462, a 181 percent growth month-on-month from 876 units, while CV sales surged 300 percent to 36 units from just nine units.

But despite the huge improvement month-on-month, vehicle importers still registered a 55 percent drop in sales in the first semester from a year ago amid the temporary closure of dealerships during the lockdown imposed by the government due to the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic.

AVID said it sold 19,455 units in the January to June period, lower than the 43,082 units sold in the same period last year as dealerships had to be closed when the government implemented an enhanced community quarantine to curb the spread of COVID-19.

AVID&amp;rsquo;s PC sales fell 60 percent to 6,111 units in the first half of the year from 15,279 units the previous year. LCV sales declined 52 percent to 13,207 units in the first six months of the year from 27,300 units a year ago, while CV sales posted a 73 percent drop to 137 units as of end-June from 503 units last year.

AVID said it remains watchful of factors that may continue to dampen automotive sales in the coming months.

&amp;ldquo;While AVID members and their partner dealerships have gone to great lengths to COVID-proof their facilities, strengthen online e-commerce assets, and offer extraordinary promotions and deals to win back customers and encourage buying, headwinds remain. These include lower remittances, weaker demand, and the prospect of a second wave, so we can&amp;rsquo;t let our guard down,&amp;rdquo; AVID president Ma. Fe Perez-Agudo said.

As AVID members are implementing measures for the new way of doing business given the pandemic, she said the group also continues to work with government to respond to the pandemic.

&amp;ldquo;This is not the industry&amp;rsquo;s first crisis, but it is surely the most challenging. We can&amp;rsquo;t face it alone, so we are closely working with government and other stakeholders to help contain this pandemic while gradually reviving the industry in a safe and sustainable manner. Mobility is key to driving the economy forward and a stronger AVID, within and beyond this pandemic, will definitely play a key role,&amp;rdquo; she said.

Earlier, she said AVID expects total automotive industry sales to decline by 40 percent this year due to disruptions caused by the health crisis.

Last year, total automotive industry sales of AVID and the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. reached more than 410,000 units.

AVID alone sold a total of 87,984 units last year, slightly lower than the 88,430 units sold in 2018.

                <![CDATA[<p>MANILA, Philippines &mdash; Sales of imported vehicles accelerated in June as the country transitioned into a more relaxed quarantine phase, but this was not enough to offset a huge drop in total sales during the first six months of the year.</p><p>In a report released yesterday, the Association of Vehicle Importers and Distributors Inc. (AVID) said sales in June nearly tripled to 3,697 units from just 1,239 units in May, with demand in all segments (passenger car or PC, commercial vehicle or CV and light commercial vehicle or LCV) growing from nearly three times to four-fold.</p><p>AVID sold 1,199 PCs in June, 239 percent higher than the 354 units in May. LCV sales reached 2,462, a 181 percent growth month-on-month from 876 units, while CV sales surged 300 percent to 36 units from just nine units.</p><p>But despite the huge improvement month-on-month, vehicle importers still registered a 55 percent drop in sales in the first semester from a year ago amid the temporary closure of dealerships during the lockdown imposed by the government due to the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>AVID said it sold 19,455 units in the January to June period, lower than the 43,082 units sold in the same period last year as dealerships had to be closed when the government implemented an enhanced community quarantine to curb the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>AVID&rsquo;s PC sales fell 60 percent to 6,111 units in the first half of the year from 15,279 units the previous year. LCV sales declined 52 percent to 13,207 units in the first six months of the year from 27,300 units a year ago, while CV sales posted a 73 percent drop to 137 units as of end-June from 503 units last year.</p><p>AVID said it remains watchful of factors that may continue to dampen automotive sales in the coming months.</p><p>&ldquo;While AVID members and their partner dealerships have gone to great lengths to COVID-proof their facilities, strengthen online e-commerce assets, and offer extraordinary promotions and deals to win back customers and encourage buying, headwinds remain. These include lower remittances, weaker demand, and the prospect of a second wave, so we can&rsquo;t let our guard down,&rdquo; AVID president Ma.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The local sugar industry has joined the call of other agriculture groups to stop the importation of various farm commodities.

Sugar groups said they are also victims of unabated importation of sugar and other sweeteners over the past years.

Among the groups include the Asociacion de Agricultores de la Carlota y Pontevedra Inc., Kabankalan-Ilog Planters Association, Sugarcane Growers Association of Bukidnon Inc., and Sugarcane Farmers of Bukidnon Multipurpose Cooperative.

The poultry and livestock groups have been calling on the Department of Agriculture to temporarily stop importation as the supply glut remains unresolved.

&amp;ldquo;At present, the sugar industry is fortunate that even with the low demand for our commodity brought about by the pandemic, the perceived shortfall in the country&amp;rsquo;s annual consumption of sugar may even-out because of a slight increase in total production in the last crop year, as compared to previous years,&amp;rdquo; the groups said.

&amp;ldquo;However, when business is back-to-normal, we may again be subjected to unabated importation that has caused misery to the millions of industry stakeholders,&amp;rdquo; they said.

The groups said the government should address first the disconnect of continued importation vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the President&amp;rsquo;s call to strengthen food security.

&amp;ldquo;We feel the urgency to call on the DA to strengthen local agriculture industries through well-meaning programs with the end view of improving productivity and self-sustainability,&amp;rdquo; they said.

The pandemic has highlighted the need for countries to be self-sustainable and reinforce their agriculture industries to strengthen their food security programs.

While neighboring countries Vietnam and Thailand are doubling their efforts to avoid dependency on importation of basic goods, particularly food, the Philippines continues to heavily rely on importation of certain commodities.

&amp;ldquo;We need to put a stop in looking at importation as the only answer when demand for supply is tight. We join the call for the DA to be more circumspect in their intervention measures, whether it&amp;rsquo;s oversupply or tightness in supply,&amp;rdquo; the groups said.

&amp;ldquo;There is no better time than now to re-assess government programs and streamline regulatory requirements to hasten modernization of our various agriculture industries,&amp;rdquo; they said.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Despite a slight uptick in June, the country&amp;rsquo;s inflation environment remains manageable, providing enough headroom for economic managers to implement policies which shield the economy from the impact of the global health crisis, according to the Department of Finance (DOF).

In a report, Finance Undersecretary and chief economist Gil Beltran said inflation remains manageable despite the supply issues arising from the&amp;nbsp; COVID-19 crisis.

&amp;ldquo;This allows significant elbow room for policymakers to sustain economic policies to support growth,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Inflation settled at 2.5 percent in June, faster than the 2.1 percent in May, but slower than the 2.7 percent recorded in the same month last year.

This brought the year-to-date growth in inflation to 2.5 percent, still well-within the government&amp;rsquo;s outlook of two to four percent for this year.

&amp;ldquo;The upward adjustment in prices is mainly traced to non-food items, in particular, transportation,&amp;rdquo; Beltran said.

He said non-food items contributed 0.9-percentage point to the June inflation, higher than the 0.35-percentage point contribution in May.

However, Beltran said that the easing of food prices helped cushion the impact of the increase in non-food items.

&amp;ldquo;In June, average food prices increased by 2.7 percent, a slower pace than the 2.9 percent price increase in the preceding month,&amp;rdquo; Beltran said.

On a month-on-month basis, Beltran said inflation rose to 0.49 percent from the 0.08 percent posted in May.

&amp;ldquo;The main reason for the month-on-month inflation raise is the 6.77 percent month-on-month increase in transportation costs as crude oil prices emerged from a global slump arising from the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Dubai crude oil prices rose to $30.47 per barrel in May, a 49.9 percent increase from $20.47 per barrel in April.

Earlier, Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Chua said the &amp;ldquo;moderate increase in inflation&amp;rdquo; indicates a recovery in consumer demand alongside the gradual reopening of the economy.

Economic managers expect the country&amp;rsquo;s gross domestic product to contract between two and 3.4 percent this year, ending 22 straight years of positive growth since the 0.5 percent gross domestic product (GDP) contraction in 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis.

To address the impact of the pandemic and protect the health of Filipinos, the government laid out a P1.74 trillion socioeconomic strategy against COVID-19.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), for its part, delivered a series of rate cuts to cushion the impact of the pandemic.

The Monetary Board has slashed interest rates by 175 basis points so far this year, bringing the overnight reverse repurchase rate to an all-time low of 2.25 percent.

It also lowered the reserve requirement ratio for big banks by 200 basis points to 12 percent on March 30 as part of its commitment to bring down the level to single digit by the middle of 2023.

                <![CDATA[(Part IV)

Over the period under review, Philippine population grew at a rate faster than some of the major economies with which it is often compared in ASEAN.

Today, these countries have made big gains in terms of human capital development relative to us. Not unexpectedly, in overall economic accomplishments as well.

Population growth: Phl, Indonesia and Thailand. Two such countries to which the Philippines is often compared with are Indonesia and Thailand.

In 1950, both Thailand and the Philippines had roughly the same population levels, at around 20 million.

The larger country, Indonesia, was more populous, with nearly 80 million people. Initially, the Philippines and Thailand each had population sizes about one-fourth (or 25 percent) of Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s.

All three countries had high population growth rates during the decade, in the range of 3.1 to 2.4 percent per year, the lower of these rates being Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s population growth rate.)

During the late 1960s, Thailand and Indonesia undertook aggressive family planning programs. The Philippines also was active in pursuing a population program designed to help reduce the high fertility rate associated with the high population growth rate.

By 1995, the results of the population planning efforts were very visible in both Thailand and Indonesia. The Philippine program had achieved some noticeable reduction in the population growth rate (from around three percent to 2.1 percent), but was far behind that achieved in the two countries that succeeded in reaching 1.1 percent growth for Thailand and 1.6 percent for Indonesia.

Thailand&amp;rsquo;s population, at 58.8 million, was already by then 10 million less people than the 68.6 million for the Philippines.

Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s population was close to 195.6 million. This meant that the Philippine population size had risen faster relative to Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s. From 25 percent of the population of Indonesia, the Philippine population had reached 35 percent.

In 2019, the comparative population sizes stood at: Thailand, 69.6 million; Indonesia, 270.2 million; and the Philippines, 108 million.

In relative sizes, the Philippines has 38.4 million more people than Thailand. With respect to Indonesia, the Philippine population is slowly, but surely, creeping up to catch up with Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s large population so that by 2019, the Philippine population represented 40 percent of Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s!

Population and living standards. Other things remaining the same, the family unit (or the nation at large) has to support the nutrition, education and other needs of the dependent-young. The cost to the family unit (or nation) rises with more young children to support.

When incomes suffer in relation to the needs, living standards fall. (For the nation, it is the same. Resources for supporting education, food production etc. could be strained.)

Of course, with the same growth rate of output, or GDP, countries with different population growth rates differ in their economic productivity.

Assuming equal GDP growth rates, the country with a lower population growth rate is able to put more of that additional output to improve the living standards, including further investments in human capital.

In addition, countries that achieve higher average growth rates are likely to run away with faster per capital growth rates of output than countries burdened by high population growth rates. There is, therefore, a double-advantage over the country burdened by more dependent-populations.

What happened to our nat&amp;rsquo;l population program? The Philippine population program fell apart after 1980.

Today, I cannot find the population program narrative in any government publications, not even in the Population Commission website. Also, there is no Wiki information to even supplement the population program story.

The Population Commission is hardly functioning. The Population Foundation has a website that has little information. It seems the organizations, like the Responsible Parenthood Association, that were quite strong in the past, have disappeared from the scene.

The population program up to 1980. This is the story as I know it first-hand. The story is erased in national memory.

In 1970 I joined the government as chairman of the National Economic Council and later as planning minister/ director general of NEDA. The population planning program then was in ferment.&amp;nbsp; I became intimately involved in the evolution of the family planning program.

Presidential Decree (PD) 79 created the Population Commission. It was a government committee of four major departments/ ministries: (1) Education; (2) Health; (3) Social Welfare; and (4) the NEDA; and (5) dean of the UP Population Institute. Later, up to four members were appointed to the commission to broaden its reach to the private sector.

The heart of the program was the participation of important government ministries that delivered services and information to families, especially women. This involved the services of the three ministries above in intricate ways &amp;ndash; in education, family planning information, health services, and welfare assistance. The Population Commission had a staff to support this coordination. Also, it dispelled direct assistance and projects in the field.

The program was supported financially from development assistance sources, principally the USAID initially, and later the UN Assistance to Family Planning Agency.

It was a large program assisted principally from aid resources at first, but it was supposed to be carried out by government gradually.

Countries with political will (like Thailand and Indonesia) got support from similar sources, but eventually they began to take over part of the finance of their own program. Eventually, they got internalized in government as well.

When the first chairperson of the Population Commission, Estefania Aldaba-Lim, who was then minister/secretary of social welfare, left the service, the Commission members asked me to succeed as chairman of the commission. This was sometime in 1976.

To strengthen the program further, I formed a task force that included Armand Fabella, Dr. Juan Flavier, Mercedes Conception of the Population Institute UP to make recommendations to further focus the program toward family welfare and to involve growing support by the national government of the program, even as foreign assistance to the program was in decline.

In 1980, I left the NEDA and, hence, the Population Commission. My successor disagreed with the program and scuttled it.

                <![CDATA[<h2>(Part IV)</h2><p>Over the period under review, Philippine population grew at a rate faster than some of the major economies with which it is often compared in ASEAN.</p><p>Today, these countries have made big gains in terms of human capital development relative to us. Not unexpectedly, in overall economic accomplishments as well.</p><p>Population growth: Phl, Indonesia and Thailand. Two such countries to which the Philippines is often compared with are Indonesia and Thailand.</p><p>In 1950, both Thailand and the Philippines had roughly the same population levels, at around 20 million.</p><p>The larger country, Indonesia, was more populous, with nearly 80 million people. Initially, the Philippines and Thailand each had population sizes about one-fourth (or 25 percent) of Indonesia&rsquo;s.</p><p>All three countries had high population growth rates during the decade, in the range of 3.1 to 2.4 percent per year, the lower of these rates being Indonesia&rsquo;s population growth rate.)</p><p>During the late 1960s, Thailand and Indonesia undertook aggressive family planning programs. The Philippines also was active in pursuing a population program designed to help reduce the high fertility rate associated with the high population growth rate.</p><p>By 1995, the results of the population planning efforts were very visible in both Thailand and Indonesia. The Philippine program had achieved some noticeable reduction in the population growth rate (from around three percent to 2.1 percent), but was far behind that achieved in the two countries that succeeded in reaching 1.1 percent growth for Thailand and 1.6 percent for Indonesia.</p><p>Thailand&rsquo;s population, at 58.8 million, was already by then 10 million less people than the 68.6 million for the Philippines.</p><p>Indonesia&rsquo;s population was close to 195.6 million. This meant that the Philippine population size had risen faster relative to Indonesia&rsquo;s. From 25 percent of the population of Indonesia, the Philippine population had reached 35 percent.</p><p>In 2019, the comparative population sizes stood at: Thailand, 69.6 million; Indonesia, 270.2 million; and the Philippines, 108 million.</p><p>In relative sizes, the Philippines has 38.4 million more people than Thailand. With respect to Indonesia, the Philippine population is slowly, but surely, creeping up to catch up with Indonesia&rsquo;s large population so that by 2019, the Philippine population represented 40 percent of Indonesia&rsquo;s!</p><p>Population and living standards. Other things remaining the same, the family unit (or the nation at large) has to support the nutrition, education and other needs of the dependent-young. The cost to the family unit (or nation) rises with more young children to support.</p><p>When incomes suffer in relation to the needs, living standards fall. (For the nation, it is the same. Resources for supporting education, food production etc. could be strained.)</p><p>Of course, with the same growth rate of output, or GDP, countries with different population growth rates differ in their economic productivity.</p><p>Assuming equal GDP growth rates, the country with a lower population growth rate is able to put more of that additional output to improve the living standards, including further investments in human capital.</p><p>In addition, countries that achieve higher average growth rates are likely to run away with faster per capital growth rates of output than countries burdened by high population growth rates. There is, therefore, a double-advantage over the country burdened by more dependent-populations.</p><p>What happened to our nat&rsquo;l population program? The Philippine population program fell apart after 1980.</p><p>Today, I cannot find the population program narrative in any government publications, not even in the Population Commission website. Also, there is no Wiki information to even supplement the population program story.</p><p>The Population Commission is hardly functioning. The Population Foundation has a website that has little information. It seems the organizations, like the Responsible Parenthood Association, that were quite strong in the past, have disappeared from the scene.</p><p>The population program up to 1980. This is the story as I know it first-hand. The story is erased in national memory.</p><p>In 1970 I joined the government as chairman of the National Economic Council and later as planning minister/ director general of NEDA. The population planning program then was in ferment.&nbsp; I became intimately involved in the evolution of the family planning program.</p><p>Presidential Decree (PD) 79 created the Population Commission. It was a government committee of four major departments/ ministries: (1) Education; (2) Health; (3) Social Welfare; and (4) the NEDA; and (5) dean of the UP Population Institute. Later, up to four members were appointed to the commission to broaden its reach to the private sector.</p><p>The heart of the program was the participation of important government ministries that delivered services and information to families, especially women. This involved the services of the three ministries above in intricate ways &ndash; in education, family planning information, health services, and welfare assistance. The Population Commission had a staff to support this coordination. Also, it dispelled direct assistance and projects in the field.</p><p>The program was supported financially from development assistance sources, principally the USAID initially, and later the UN Assistance to Family Planning Agency.</p><p>It was a large program assisted principally from aid resources at first, but it was supposed to be carried out by government gradually.</p><p>Countries with political will (like Thailand and Indonesia) got support from similar sources, but eventually they began to take over part of the finance of their own program. Eventually, they got internalized in government as well.</p><p>When the first chairperson of the Population Commission, Estefania Aldaba-Lim, who was then minister/secretary of social welfare, left the service, the Commission members asked me to succeed as chairman of the commission.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Government-owned Land Bank of the Philippines has released P3.02 billion in loans to farmers as part of efforts to help boost productivity of the local farm sector.

Land Bank said the loans have been released under the Department of Agriculture&amp;rsquo;s programs aimed at providing affordable financial assistance to farmers and fishers to help increase their productivity and profitability.

Under the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF), Landbank released a total of P2.5 billion in loans to 19,367 eligible borrowers as of the end of June.

Of the total borrowers, 19,189 are small farmers and fisherfolk, 119 are micro and small enterprises, and 59 are farmers and fisherfolk cooperatives and associations.

Direct lending under the ACEF has been made available to eligible borrowers at an interest rate of two percent per annum.

Individual farmers and fisherfolk may use the loan for the purchase of farm inputs and equipment or for farm improvement. For MSEs, cooperatives and associations, the loan may be used for the acquisition of machinery, equipment and facilities for agri-based production and post-production, as well as processing.

Another P527.3 million was released to 3,115 rice farmers and 22 cooperatives under the Expanded Rice Credit Assistance of the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund following the Rice Tariffication Law.

Landbank is one of the implementing agencies for the P1-billion RCEF allocation for credit.&amp;nbsp; It is mandated to make available P500 million in loans annually to rice farmers in 59 out of 80 rice-producing provinces.

Direct lending is available to eligible borrowers at an interest rate of two percent per annum. For on-lending, interest rate is at zero percent with prescribed pass-on rate to end-borrowers of up to six percent per annum.

                <![CDATA[Magic mambo jumbo to get us out of our miseries? No. Those are three different economic stimulus plans. ARISE: Accelerated Recovery and Investment. CREATE: Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises. CURES: COVID-19 Unemployment Reduction and Economic Stimulus

It is almost as if our bureaucrats and legislators are in a contest and having a fun time over beer trying to come up with the best acronyms to win over an increasingly exasperated and skeptical citizenry.

Actually, there is no agreement on what an ideal stimulus program should look like. The big problem is that our National Treasury is empty.

While we have the capacity to borrow to finance an economic stimulus program, the Constitution prevents us from funding a supplemental budget out of borrowings, only through savings&amp;hellip; something we don&amp;rsquo;t have.

We, taxpayers, wish we can get back to business. The economy can&amp;rsquo;t wait too long to get revived.

The situation on the ground is dire as we common folks know. Local unemployment is on the rise. OFWs are coming home in droves. Small and medium size enterprises are closing down or downsizing staff.

Many industries, like tourism, do not see a future this year, and next year is still in doubt. Travel agencies must have laid off their staff by now. The only calls they get are from angry clients who want refunds on their airline tickets.

BPOs are struggling with new work rules, including the need to work from home. Their office buildings are constantly shut down with every reported COVID case.

Manufacturing is down. Schools and colleges are confused on whether they can hold classes this year or not.

The transportation industry is as befuddled as others while waiting for government to promulgate or clarify new rules. The DOTr doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be in a big hurry to solve very obvious transport problems within NCR and the country.

The airlines are keeping busy doing special flights to ferry home stranded Filipino workers in foreign ports. They are eager to get back to normal flights, or as close to it as they can, but it is an elusive goal.

Forget the entertainment industry. Movie houses remain closed. No concerts can be held. Performing artists have been idled. The only really significant entertainment company for most of our people that is providing food for the table for over 11,000 souls has been closed down out of political vendetta.

The only segment of the economy that seems to be doing really well are supermarkets and drugstores. But they have their problems too as new rules keep on coming on how they can do business.

Also busy are government offices issuing all sorts of new permits required to get around the country. It may now be easier to get a visa from a foreign embassy than a permit to go home to your province.

Hospitals seem to be doing good business, but not in a way that makes them happy. Several major hospitals issued notices last Monday their COVID facilities are full. Also busy are the funeral parlors. They have more dead people than they can handle.

The dying and the dead just about sum up the situation out there. People are being patient. Some are desperate. Everyone needs help.

The pandemic and the lockdown shocked us. We no longer want to spend money for anything beyond the absolute necessities. But we need to create more demand. Otherwise, there is no work and people go hungry.

The drop in consumer demand has been sharp. Shorter mall hours and all sorts of conflicting, nonsensical restrictions on operations are killing the retail industry, and the impact goes down to the factories like those producing clothing for the local market.

An industry source told me close to half of their workers have been furloughed. More people continue to lose more jobs this way, depressing demand further.

But we are a resourceful people. In this pandemic era, out of work people discovered the online selling business and just as fast, the BIR required them to register and pay taxes, past and present.

Online selling by housewives would have helped families earn some income while the main wage earner is on furlough from his company. The BIR should have more empathy, more sympathy, as Joey Concepcion repeatedly urged in a Zoom session I attended.

Looking at our ailing economy at street level makes me wonder how all these alphabet soup stimulus plans can provide quick relief for families with a nasty habit of eating three meals a day.

Maybe fixing the rules by which we are to live by in this new normal is a faster way of waking the economy up. It should be easy to get IATF, cities and provinces to agree on common rules governing malls, supermarkets and other retail establishments.

But clarity is anathema to this administration. The bureaucracy thrives in confusion as this creates opportunities for corruption.

In the meantime, while policy makers and legislators argue what kind of assistance the economy needs, we can ruminate on the large numbers they are throwing around.

Wage subsidy: P110-billion. DOLE cash for Work Program: P25 billion. Education (P42 billion), small business (P75 billion) and agri-fishery loans (P50 billion), loan guarantee (P40 billion). Tourism (P58 billion), Transportation (P70 billion). Manufacturing, exports, services (P44 billion).

There are proposals to reduce the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and provide all sorts of incentives to private corporations in the hope corporations will reinvest these savings, create multiplier in jobs and income.

But to cover the deficit, there will be increased or new taxes on beverages, e-business, junk food and cigarettes that will all have a negative impact on consumer demand. Yet, corporations may not even invest all the largesse they will get from government.

In a free-falling economy or anemic recovery, corporations batten their hatches: pay down debts, buy back shares, but not invest. Rep. Stella Quimbo noted that corporates invest tax savings only when the economy is growing.

Yet we waste money on silly programs like Balik Probinsya: (P66 billion),National Emergency Investment Vehicle (NEIV) (P100 billion) for recovery of businesses.

We are a mess. Hopefully we find our way soon.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Creditor banks have engaged in talks with Lopez-led ABS-CBN Corp. over its outstanding P27.04 billion obligations after the House of Representative denied the renewal of the media giant&amp;rsquo;s.

Edwin Bautista, president and chief executive officer of Aboitiz-led Union Bank of the Philippines, told The STAR the Aboitiz-led bank is confident ABS-CBN would be able to continue servicing its financial obligations.

&amp;ldquo;ABS-CBN is not in arrears in its loan payments to UnionBank. They have also publicly disclosed that they will continue paying their financial liabilities according to their repayment schedules,&amp;rdquo; Bautista said in a text message.

Bautista pointed out that ABS-CBN has been a customer of the bank for many years and its robust financial condition is recognized.

&amp;ldquo;We anticipate that ABS-CBN will rationalize its operations and downsize with the non-renewal of the franchise. Nonetheless, we recognize that ABS-CBN&amp;rsquo;s other businesses, such as global, film syndication and distribution, and its preeminent position as a strong and reliable content creator are unaffected by the non-renewal,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Based on its latest financial statement, the outstanding term loans of ABS-CBN stood at P27.04 billion as of end-September last year. UnionBank has the biggest share with P11.35 billion, followed by Ayala-led Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) with P10 billion.

ABS-CBN obtained a 10-year loan term agreement worth P5 billion in May last year and another P4.75 billion syndicated loan agreement in March 2016 with UnionBank.

It also entered into a seven-year loan agreement with BPI worth P6 billion in March 2018.

BPI president and chief executive officer Cezar Consing said the 168-year-old bank is committed to being as supportive as possible of its clients, including ABS-CBN, through difficult times.

&amp;ldquo;We have been in very constructive discussions with ABS-CBN and, with their cooperation, will shortly enter into arrangements that will enhance the risk profile of our loan exposures to the company.&amp;nbsp; These arrangements will include cash and security arrangements,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Consing added that the bank has been informed that ABS-CBN would continue to operate in other businesses that do not require franchises such as their international licensing and distribution, digital and cable businesses.

&amp;ldquo;We appreciate ABS-CBN&amp;rsquo;s commitment to service their loan obligations according to existing payment schedules,&amp;rdquo; Consing added.

Voting 70-11, the House of Representatives rejected the renewal of the broadcasting franchise of ABS-CBN last July 10, putting in limbo the status of the&amp;nbsp; company&amp;rsquo;s 11,000 workers.

For its part, the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) said member banks are expected to manage their credit portfolio in relation to the non-renewal of the ABS-CBN broadcast franchise, while the country continues to battle the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic.

&amp;ldquo;The banking industry remains strongly capitalized and in solid liquidity position to manage credit risks,&amp;rdquo; BAP said in a statement. Consing is also president of the BAP.

The group added the prudential measures instituted by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) allowed the banking industry to remain strong and healthy through the years that enabled the banks to withstand various crises.

&amp;ldquo;In the midst of today&amp;rsquo;s pandemic and concerns on the non-renewal of the ABS-CBN broadcast franchise, we strongly believe that banks will continue to be steadfast as they are supported by strong financial conditions, robust risk management systems and a good corporate governance,&amp;rdquo; it said.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Digital payments through the automated clearing houses established by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) reached P341 billion in June as the country transitioned to general community quarantine.

According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the value and volume of transactions under the InstaPay and the PESONet&amp;nbsp; rose by 92 percent from the&amp;nbsp; P178 billion recorded in January.

Likewise, the volume of transactions surged by 196 percent to 21 million last month from only 7.1 million in January.

PESONet launched in November 2017 is appropriate for high value transactions of companies, other businesses, government entities, and individuals, while InstaPay introduced in April 2018 is used for urgent and small value retail transactions of up to P50,000.

Both automated clearing houses are part of the National Retail Payment System (NRPS) launched in December 2015 to transform the country to cashlite from a cash heavy economy with digital payments accounting for 20 percent by 2020.

The BSP said InstaPay transfers jumped by 157 percent in terms of value to P100.3 billion in June from P39.1 billion in January as volume surged by 218 percent to 18.3 million transactions from 5.8 million transactions.

The regulator noted that the highest growth in terms of volume was recorded at 57 percent to 4.6 million transactions in May from 1.1 million in April.

On the other hand, PESONet transactions recorded a 73 percent surge to P240.6 billion in June from P138.88 billion in January as volume almost doubled to 2.21 million transactions from 1.32 million.

The BSP noted a drop in the volume of PESONet transactions from one million in June as the social amelioration of 3.2 million beneficiaries under the Social Security System&amp;rsquo;s small business wage subsidy (SBWS) program were disbursed by the government via PESONet in May.

For June, the BSP said top InstaPay sending participants include G-Xchange Inc. (GCash) with 6.41 million, BDO Unibank with 2.51 million, Ayala-led Bank of the Philippine Islands with 1.99 million, PayMaya Philippines with 1.88 million, and Metropolitan Bank &amp;amp; Trust Co. with 1.41 million, while receiving participants include GCash with 4.11 million, BDO with 4.1 million, BPI with 3.16 million, PayMaya with 1.1 million and Aboitiz-led Union Bank with 1.02 million.

On the other hand, top PESONet sending participants include Development Bank of the Philippines, UnionBank, Citibank, BDO, Bank of America, while top receiving banks include BDO, BPI, Metrobank, UnionBank, and Security Bank.

BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno has committed to raise the share of digital transactions in terms of value and volume to 50 percent by the end of his term in the middle of 2023 as part of efforts to transform the Philippines to a cash-lite economy.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The stock market ended flat again yesterday as&amp;nbsp; investors see no impetus yet to return to the market as they await for new quarantine guidelines and as traders worry over the long term impact of the ABS-CBN closure.

The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) finished at 6,172.81, struggling to stay afloat with an uptick of 0.24 points or 0.004 percent.

The broader All Shares index slumped to 3,625.85, down 7.90 points or 0.21 percent.

Most indexes ended in negative territory led by mining and oil, industrial and services sectors.

Total value turnover reached P5.127 billion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Market breadth was negative with 126 losers and&amp;nbsp; 87 gainers, while 29 issues were left unchanged.

Philstocks Financials said in a commentary: &amp;ldquo;The local bourse ended the session flat, adding only 0.24 points to 6,172.81, due to lack of strong catalyst while investors await new quarantine guidelines.&amp;rdquo;

Asian markets were in the red due to profit taking, Philstocks also said.

Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital, meanwhile, attributed the flat trading session to the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s rejection of China&amp;rsquo;s expansive claims in the South China Sea, which is seen to escalate tensions with Beijing on yet another front.

&amp;ldquo;The move reverses a previous policy of not taking sides in territorial disputes in the region. In the past, the US has called for protecting freedom of navigation in the contested waterway while stopping short of taking a position on specific territorial claims,&amp;rdquo; Limlingan said.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Remittances worldwide, especially those flowing into traditional labor-sending countries like the Philippines, will take a hit through a &amp;ldquo;country stigma&amp;rdquo; attached to workers coming from areas struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said.

In a blog entry, Werner Liepach, director general of ADB&amp;rsquo;s Central and West Asia Department, and Guntur Sugiyarto, principal economist of ADB&amp;rsquo;s Pakistan resident mission, said while migration and remittances have proven to be &amp;ldquo;very resilient&amp;rdquo; in past global crises, the new coronavirus pandemic is changing this as labor-importing states may mark countries with weak capability to control the spread of the virus among its population.

&amp;ldquo;The pandemic has put a &amp;ldquo;country stigma&amp;rdquo; to the migrant workers from areas that have been struggling to cope with the pandemic and this may prevent them from entering other countries. Worse still, they may even be prohibited from exiting their own countries by their governments if the pandemic has become uncontrollable.

If blocked from finding work overseas, there is no guarantee that the migrants can find an alternative job, which have become scarce,&amp;rdquo; the ADB economists said.

Migrants may also be most likely to be excluded in the list of targeted groups for government incentives and social programs, as public resources become strained.

The impact, they said, could be &amp;ldquo;devastating&amp;rdquo; because of the effect of diminished remittances on poverty reduction and educational attainment in developing countries.

Asia has been contributing to more than 40 percent of total migration worldwide, with South and Central Asia as main sources.

For traditional migrant-sending countries, these overseas workers have constituted more than 10 percent of their labor force.

&amp;ldquo;The pandemic has created an unprecedented crisis for overseas workers and the remittances they send home. But with the right actions by governments, it could also be a chance for long-term change,&amp;rdquo; the authors said.

Governments of sending countries, they said, must work with their international and domestic counterparts to facilitate re-entry of migrants to the destination countries.

This can be done by ensuring that the migrants are healthy and ready to be deployed using special transportation, such as chartered flights, to resume their work.

&amp;ldquo;This will require high-level diplomacy and strategic action at the country and regional levels,&amp;rdquo; the ADB economists said.

For workers waiting to be redeployed overseased they said governments must make use of migrants as part of the recovery program in the domestic economy.

This can be done by employing this productive workforce and using the new knowledge and skills that the migrants acquired abroad. This may entail additional resources to help small and medium enterprises hire these workers, which will create much bigger multiplier effects in the economy.

&amp;ldquo;This approach is called a utilization of &amp;lsquo;social remittance&amp;rsquo;, and it can also promote innovation. If governments get this right, re-deployment of these workers would no longer be needed and they could be integrated into the domestic economy. This would strengthen the workforce and improve overall productivity,&amp;rdquo; the authors said.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Banks in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, face rising bad loans and weakening profitability as businesses grapple with the economic fallout from the pandemic, according to&amp;nbsp; Moody&amp;rsquo;s Investors Service.

In a report, Moody&amp;rsquo;s said the Philippines, with Singapore and Malaysia have the best asset quality and low non-performing loan (NPL) ratios among member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). But their asset quality and profitability may deteriorate amid the challenging economic and credit conditions in the region.

The debt watcher expects the Philippine economy to contract by 4.5 percent this year, ending more than two decades of positive growth. The last time the Philippine economy contracted was in 1998 with 0.5 percent due to the Asian financial crisis.

The projected slowdown in the Philippines this year is&amp;nbsp; faster that Indonesia&amp;rsquo;s 0.8 percent, Malaysia&amp;rsquo;s 1.8 percent, but slower than Singapore&amp;rsquo;s five percent and Thailand&amp;rsquo;s 5.5 percent. Vietnam is the only ASEAN member that is expected to post a positive GDP growth of 2.5 percent this year.

&amp;ldquo;Relaxation of lockdowns and resumption of economic activity will be key drivers of recovery,&amp;rdquo; Moody&amp;rsquo;s said.

Moody&amp;rsquo;s said the extent of loan deterioration would depend on the pace of economic recovery, efficiency of government support and regulatory forbearance.

It added recognition of problem borrowers is likely to accelerate next year as loan payment moratorium are lifted or relaxed. According to Moody&amp;rsquo;s, share of loans under moratorium is highest in Malaysia and lowest in Vietnam.

Latest data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed the NPL ratio of Philippine banks rose for the fifth straight month to hit a five-year high of 2.43 percent in May from 2.31 percent in April due, to the sharp rise in past due, as well as restructured loans as businesses grappled with the effects of the hard lockdown.

Moody&amp;rsquo;s said net interest income of banks may decrease due to margin contraction, while credit costs are expected to rise due to weaker asset quality.

Earnings of Philippine banks grew by 9.3 percent to P59.66 billion in the first quarter from P54.59 billion in the same quarter last year despite higher provisioning to prepare for the onslaught of bad loans due to the pandemic.

The debt watcher said government support would help alleviate some pressure on banks. Support packages, including moratorium on debt payments, monetary policy easing, liquidity injections or relaxation of bank reserves, small and medium enterprises credit guarantees, cash to households and relaxation of capital norms, are unprecedented in the regional trade bloc.

For one, measures undertaken by the BSP, including the 175 basis points cut in interest rates to a record low of 2.25 percent and the lowering of the reserve requirement ratio, have unleashed P1.3 trillion into the financial system.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; DMCI Holdings, the listed engineering and infrastructure conglomerate of the Consunji Group, is bracing for a drop in consolidated earnings this year as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic.

The company which survived the 1997 Asian financial crisis is adapting to the new environment by reducing operating costs and keeping its balance sheet strong, its chairman Isidro Consunji said&amp;nbsp; during the company&amp;rsquo;s annual stockholders meeting yesterday.

As part of the austerity measures, the company has slashed its 2020 capital expenditures by 52 percent to P19.4 billion, with its property arm DMCI Homes sustaining the biggest cut&amp;nbsp; to P14 billion from P31 billion.

DMCI Homes is capping its land acquisitions to P4 billion, a 79 percent decline from its original plan of P19 billion.

&amp;ldquo;We expect weak demand and low selling prices to affect most of our businesses,&amp;rdquo; Consunji said.

He said construction arm D.M. Consunji Inc. could show more resilience if supported by massive public spending and timely issuance of permits and rights-of-way,&amp;rdquo; said Consunji.

&amp;ldquo;At this stage of the pandemic, we cannot predict how the business environment will evolve, but it will definitely take some time before our company can rebound to its pre-pandemic income and dividend payout levels,&amp;rdquo; he said.

But Consunji assured stakeholders about the holding company&amp;rsquo;s strong financial position.

&amp;ldquo;We are debt-free at the parent level, which gives us the flexibility and financial standing to tap credit facilities and funding sources, if needed,&amp;rdquo; he said.

DMCI&amp;rsquo;s businesses are coal through Semirara Mining and Power Corp., property through DMCI Homes, construction and infrastructure through D.M. Consunji, power through DMCI Power and water through a stake in Maynilad Water Services Inc.

The company posted a net income of P10.5 billion, down 27 percent because of weak coal prices, lower construction accomplishments and an impairment loss for mining assets in Zambales.

&amp;ldquo;Excluding non-recurring losses, core net income fell 14 percent to P12.4 billion.

The non-recurring losses mostly pertain to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of P1.6 billion for the&amp;nbsp; 2014 acquisition of Zambales Diversified Metals Corp. and Zambales Chromite Mining Co.,&amp;rdquo; Consunji said.

&amp;ldquo;Fortunately, we can count on our healthy balance sheet and low debt exposure to sustain us during this difficult time...I would like to assure you that our board and management are fully committed to safeguarding the long-term value of our company.&amp;nbsp; With your continued trust and confidence, I believe we can bravely face the future and weather this crisis,&amp;rdquo; Consunji said.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; A former tourism executive of Aurora province, whose brainchild made Baler the birthplace of Philippine surfing, has been appointed as regional director for the Department of Tourism&amp;rsquo;s Calabarzon unit.

In a statement, DOT-Calabarzon said Michael Angara Palispis was sworn in by Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat as tourism director for Region 4-A.

Palispis has years of experience in the tourism industry, previously serving as the provincial tourism officer of Aurora. In 2010, he was awarded the Most Outstanding Tourism Officer of the Philippines by the Department of Tourism-Association of Tourism Officers of the Philippines (DOT-ATOP).

He said Aurora and Calabarzon share the same tourism promise, with the same offerings and resources from their landscape to their history, culture and people.

Palispis said he will replicate in Region 4-A how he positioned Central Luzon during his term as president of Association of Tourism Officer of Central Luzon (ATOCEL), a position he held for six straight years.

He said his first order of business is to fast-track all DOT accreditation of tourism enterprises as the industry begins to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

&amp;ldquo;Our tourism chief can rest assured that Region 4-A will deliver. The goal is to process and release all pending applications for accreditation, including serving certificates of authority to operate to accommodation and tourism establishments across the Southern Tagalog region,&amp;rdquo; he added.

DOT stressed earlier that all accommodation establishments that intend to commence commercial operations in community quarantine zones, whether for the accommodation of guests or operations of in-house food facilities for take&amp;ndash;out or delivery, shall secure a DOT Certificate of Authority to Operate prior to any operations.

To secure the certification, DOT&amp;ndash;accredited hotels and other accommodation establishments need only to submit to the DOT Regional Office with jurisdiction over their area the letter of intent to operate, while non-DOT-accredited hotels and accommodation establishments will need to apply for accreditation to ensure compliance of basic requirements.

Under the interim guidelines for the application for accreditation of tourism enterprises, there are three types of certifications that a tourism enterprise may receive particularly the certificate of accreditation, certificate of provisional accreditation and a certificate of basic registration.

Moreover, Palispis said that as soon as the situation permits, he wanted to start organizing Calabarzon&amp;rsquo;s tourist destinations into clusters based on their available resources and products, committing to develop them to their maximum potentials.

&amp;ldquo;The plan is to complement each destination, rather than pit them against one another,&amp;rdquo; Palispis said adding that the region can sell its tourism products more conveniently and easily.

                <![CDATA[<p>MANILA, Philippines &mdash; A former tourism executive of Aurora province, whose brainchild made Baler the birthplace of Philippine surfing, has been appointed as regional director for the Department of Tourism&rsquo;s Calabarzon unit.</p><p>In a statement, DOT-Calabarzon said Michael Angara Palispis was sworn in by Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat as tourism director for Region 4-A.</p><p>Palispis has years of experience in the tourism industry, previously serving as the provincial tourism officer of Aurora. In 2010, he was awarded the Most Outstanding Tourism Officer of the Philippines by the Department of Tourism-Association of Tourism Officers of the Philippines (DOT-ATOP).</p><p>He said Aurora and Calabarzon share the same tourism promise, with the same offerings and resources from their landscape to their history, culture and people.</p><p>Palispis said he will replicate in Region 4-A how he positioned Central Luzon during his term as president of Association of Tourism Officer of Central Luzon (ATOCEL), a position he held for six straight years.</p><p>He said his first order of business is to fast-track all DOT accreditation of tourism enterprises as the industry begins to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>&ldquo;Our tourism chief can rest assured that Region 4-A will deliver. The goal is to process and release all pending applications for accreditation, including serving certificates of authority to operate to accommodation and tourism establishments across the Southern Tagalog region,&rdquo; he added.</p><p>DOT stressed earlier that all accommodation establishments that intend to commence commercial operations in community quarantine zones, whether for the accommodation of guests or operations of in-house food facilities for take&ndash;out or delivery, shall secure a DOT Certificate of Authority to Operate prior to any operations.</p><p>To secure the certification, DOT&ndash;accredited hotels and other accommodation establishments need only to submit to the DOT Regional Office with jurisdiction over their area the letter of intent to operate, while non-DOT-accredited hotels and accommodation establishments will need to apply for accreditation to ensure compliance of basic requirements.</p><p>Under the interim guidelines for the application for accreditation of tourism enterprises, there are three types of certifications that a tourism enterprise may receive particularly the certificate of accreditation, certificate of provisional accreditation and a certificate of basic registration.</p><p>Moreover, Palispis said that as soon as the situation permits, he wanted to start organizing Calabarzon&rsquo;s tourist destinations into clusters based on their available resources and products, committing to develop them to their maximum potentials.</p><p>&ldquo;The plan is to complement each destination, rather than pit them against one another,&rdquo; Palispis said adding that the region can sell its tourism products more conveniently and easily.</p>

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Grab is beefing up its GrabPay service as it partners with InstaPay to enable instant transfer of funds.

With the partnership, Grab said its users can now instantly load their GrabPay wallet through local banks&amp;rsquo; online banking system and through other e-wallet players.

The firm said funds in GrabPay wallet can also be transferred back instantly to bank accounts and e-wallets for withdrawal.

&amp;ldquo;We are constantly looking for ways to improve our services to stay true to our commitment of providing Filipinos safer and convenient ways to perform digital transactions,&amp;rdquo; GrabPay Philippines head Jonny Bates said.

&amp;ldquo;Building trust by connecting more digital channels and giving flexibility to move around funds help us break barriers in providing hassle-free transactions for our users. We are glad to be doing this with InstaPay with the oversight of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),&amp;rdquo; Bates said.

InstaPay is an electronic fund transfer service that allows transfer of Philippine peso funds instantly between accounts of banks and e-wallets in the country.

With InstaPay, Grab said the need to physically go to payment centers just to cash in to their GrabPay wallet would be eliminated and would enable seamless flow of money from different sources.

With the many benefits from the partnership between GrabPay and InstaPay, the company said Filipinos could seamlessly adapt to a cashless lifestyle.

&amp;ldquo;InstaPay was launched as one of the efforts of the National Retail Payment System to establish a safe and reliable electronic retail payments system in the Philippines,&amp;rdquo; said Aristeo Zafra Jr., CEO of InstaPay clearing switch operator.

&amp;ldquo;With Grab and its services playing a huge role in Filipinos&amp;rsquo; daily lives&amp;mdash; especially during this pandemic&amp;mdash; we know GrabPay&amp;rsquo;s integration with InstaPay will make everyday transactions much more convenient and accessible for Filipinos,&amp;rdquo; Zafra said.

GrabPay continues to bolster efforts to provide cashless convenience and safer payments with the increasing need for cashless solutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among its recent efforts include the expansion of online payment acceptance channels within and outside the Grab app and the launch of the digital-first GrabPay Card.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said the public and private sectors need to work closely together to ensure energy security and attain the vision of an energy independent Philippines.

In a recent virtual conference, Cusi said both the government and the private sector &amp;ldquo;must band together, because in unity there is power.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;The government can only do so much. I cannot overemphasize the support of the private sector and our energy advocates in realizing our dream of an energy secure and energy independent Philippines. Let us make it happen in our lifetime,&amp;rdquo; he said.

In promoting the country&amp;rsquo;s renewable resources, Cusi said the development should be pursued without sacrificing the achievement of the country&amp;rsquo;s energy security.

This as he stressed the need to achieve energy security, as the agency adopted a technology neutral stand on power development.

&amp;ldquo;There is a need to strike a balance between meeting our current energy needs and building a better and cleaner world for the coming generations. Reality makes us realize that we cannot sacrifice one in favor of the other,&amp;rdquo; Cusi said.

As the current energy situation &amp;ldquo;leaves much to be desired,&amp;rdquo; Cusi said all options in power sourcing should be considered, including the possibility of tapping nuclear energy in the future.

&amp;ldquo;This is why the DOE is looking at developing all possible energy sources, including nuclear, to help the Philippines become energy secure,&amp;rdquo; Cusi said.

To show his full support to the full implementation of Republic Act (RA) 9513 or the Renewable Energy (RE) Act of 2008, Cusi has ordered a periodic review of the law &amp;ldquo;to see where we are at the moment and find stronger ways to promote our indigenous resources.&amp;rdquo;

RA 9513 promotes the development of the country&amp;rsquo;s renewable resources, including the provision of additional incentives for geothermal advancement.

&amp;ldquo;We cannot be at the mercy of global market volatilities, geopolitical movements, or pandemics. This is why we must ensure that our energy agenda directly responds to the unique needs of our country&amp;rsquo;s energy landscape. We cannot fit a square peg in a round hole,&amp;rdquo; he said.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Emperador Inc., the Andrew Tan-led listed spirits manufacturer, saw robust growth in international sales in the first half despite the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic.

The company has seen strong businesses for its brandy and whisky segments in the United States, Sweden, Spain, Indo-China, United Kingdom, Russia, and China.

Emperador subsidiary Whyte and Mackay Ltd. reported a 34 percent growth in sales volume during the period, driven mainly by Whyte &amp;amp; Mackay Blended Scotch, which consistently ranks as the No. 2 most-selling standard whisky in Scotland.

Similarly, whisky sales in Russia increased 69 percent due to strong commercial and marketing fundamentals.&amp;nbsp; This was driven by strong performance of several premium brands under Whyte &amp;amp; Mackay such as Jura, Emperador&amp;rsquo;s single malt Scotch whisky brand.

Glenn Manlapaz, chief executive officer of Emperador International,&amp;nbsp; said China has bounced back quickly after it re-opened its economy.

&amp;ldquo;We are pleasantly surprised at China&amp;rsquo;s remarkable resilience and its strong preference for luxury and super premium goods has returned so quickly as it began its V-curve recovery. In fact, our sales orders for June and July alone are 125 percent more than the same period last year,&amp;rdquo; Manlapaz said.

Whyte &amp;amp; Mackay&amp;rsquo;s business yielded a remarkable portfolio growth.

The company also saw strong business for The Dalmore&amp;nbsp; and Fettercairn across China as the country eased up its quarantine lockdowns during the second quarter.

Moving forward, Manlapaz said the company is optimistic&amp;nbsp; Whyte and Mackay&amp;rsquo;s full-year revenue in China would more than double this year.

Whyte and Mackay currently owns and operates five whisky distilleries in Scotland.

                <![CDATA[The inaugural episode of The Philippine STAR&amp;rsquo;s sports on-line talk show &amp;ldquo;Beyond The Game With The Dean&amp;rdquo; was a blast last Monday with over 25,500 views registered on The Philippine STAR and Pilipino Star Ngayon Facebook pages as guest stars Terrence Romeo, Scottie Thompson, Beau Belga, Jeron Teng and Kiefer Ravena shared insights, poked fun at each other and revealed secrets in an hour-long session that focused on the theme &amp;ldquo;The PBA: Season On The Brink.&amp;rdquo;

Viewers sent in questions which the PBA players readily answered. What came out clearly in the show was the players&amp;rsquo; all-out support for the PBA Board of Governors and commissioner Willie Marcial in getting ready for the restart of training under strict safety protocols. The IATF recently allowed the PBA to resume training limited to five at a time each workout with no scrimmaging under GCQ. The five will be composed of four players and a trainer. Under MGCQ, participation will increase to 10.

Jeron and Beau sent video clips of their home conditioning. The clips were shown in the program. Kiefer, Scottie and Terrence said they&amp;rsquo;ve been staying in shape doing drills. Beau said he lifts weights in his garage which has been converted into a gym room and watches his diet. Jeron said he&amp;rsquo;s lucky he can practice shooting in a makeshift halfcourt at home with brother Jeric. They all can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get back on the court.

Jeron said he&amp;rsquo;ll miss the fans because if the PBA is allowed to restart the season under MGCQ, there will be no live audience. But it&amp;rsquo;s a situation the players will have to adjust to. At least, fans will catch all the action on TV. Beau joked Scottie that with no fans in the stands, Ginebra will lose its fabled sixth man and it&amp;rsquo;ll be a level playing field.

Asked if he preferred a season with two or three conferences, Scottie said three. Again, Beau interjected and joked why not six? Obviously, the more conferences, the more finals, the more bonuses. Kiefer described NLEX coach Yeng Guiao as extremely attentive to details and learned a lot from him during the FIBA World Cup last year and continues to learn from him with the Road Warriors. Kiefer said his choices for the three greatest PBA players of all time are June Mar Fajardo whom he called a game changer, Ramon Fernandez and Jimmy Alapag.

Beau said what irks him is when a defender pulls his jersey, more than if he&amp;rsquo;s submarined or a referee misses a call. Beau said he&amp;rsquo;s never a victim of &amp;ldquo;sahod&amp;rdquo; because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t jump anyway, drawing laughter from everybody.

Terrence talked about his Instagram contest TR Moves where he gave away prizes to those who sent in videos showing handles imitating his routine. It was his way of giving back to fans and encouraging them to hone their skills. Over 2,000 fans joined his two-part contest. He said PBA point guards are excellent ballhandlers, naming Kiefer and Roi Sumang among them. Terrence described San Miguel Beer coach Leo Austria as &amp;ldquo;mabait.&amp;rdquo; In a revelation, he said his foreign lineage comes from his half-Italian father.

Scottie said during the lockdown, a barber would come over to his house while his Thompson&amp;rsquo;s Sports Hair Shops were closed. He called coach Tim Cone the GOAT, the greatest of all time and said his foreign surname comes from his great grandfather who was African-American. Scottie said Ginebra will be ready to battle when the season re-opens and gave his thumbs-up to rookies Jerrick Balanza, Arvin Tolentino and Kent Salado whom he expects to contribute significantly.

Kiefer said NLEX rookie Mike Ayonayon will play a big role with the Road Warriors. He said Ayonayon is an experienced rookie with MPBL creds and actually a year older than him. Beau said Rain or Shine&amp;rsquo;s rookies Adrian Wong, Prince Rivero, Vince Tolentino and Clint Doliguez are a good fit in coach Caloy Garcia&amp;rsquo;s system. His one-word description for Garcia was &amp;ldquo;magaling.&amp;rdquo; If they were in the NBA, Kiefer, Jeron and Scottie said their ideal teammate would be Dallas&amp;rsquo; Luka Doncic who&amp;rsquo;s a do-it-all player. &amp;nbsp;Kiefer said &amp;ldquo;angas&amp;rdquo; is often misinterpreted to be &amp;ldquo;mayabang&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s only about wanting to win and playing hard which is in every PBA player&amp;rsquo;s DNA.

Thanks to everyone who watched the show, to Philippine Star management (president/CEO Miguel Belmonte, executive vice president Lucien Dy Tioco and vice president for operations Tammy Mendoza) for the all-out support, to sponsors San Miguel Corp. and Smart Communications, to Star account supervisor Mike Maneze for conceptualizing &amp;ldquo;Beyond The Game,&amp;rdquo; to Star strategic sales and marketing manager Crizza Dealino Kaw, to the Star&amp;rsquo;s Mark Cunanan, Jam Cabiles and Ryo Magsino, to Jester of Olern, to Cristina Ngkaion for the coordination and to our guest stars. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the next episode on July 27 to go &amp;ldquo;Beyond The Game.&amp;rdquo;

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The PBA is looking into what could be an unauthorized practice held by the Blackwater Elite ahead of the league&amp;rsquo;s official training restart.

&amp;ldquo;Susulatan natin ang Blackwater (We&amp;rsquo;ll write Blackwater a letter to get its side),&amp;rdquo; PBA commissioner Willie Marcial said in the wake of the session that might be in violation of the league&amp;rsquo;s guidelines.

The PBA actually got the greenlight from the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) to resume non-scrimmage training sessions in small groups last July 3.

But Marcial maintained the pro league hasn&amp;rsquo;t officially flagged off practices yet pending completion of the mandatory swab testing for all teams. The target is July 22 at the earliest.

&amp;ldquo;Bawal pa, wala pang clearance from the PBA (Teams are not cleared to practice yet),&amp;rdquo; stressed Marcial, declining to say what sanction, if ever, awaits the Elite.

Blackwater, according to owner Dioceldo Sy in Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s Sports Page on TV5, practiced over the weekend observing the PBA&amp;rsquo;s safety guidelines.

&amp;ldquo;I personally saw them last Saturday. I went to the practice. I saw the protocol. What we&amp;rsquo;re doing is very strict,&amp;rdquo; Sy said.

Marcial has warned of hefty fines for the protocol breach starting from P20,000 up to P100,000 for repeat offenses.

There&amp;rsquo;s also a corresponding fine pegged of at least P5,000 for players who would falsely declare &amp;ndash; or deliberately omit &amp;ndash; their activities outside the required home-gym-home daily routine during the workouts.

Meanwhile, Marcial said the pro league has allowed the teams to give players with soon-to-expire contracts an extension until the end of the year.

&amp;ldquo;Nagdesisyon ang governors lahat ng players extended hanggang Dec. 31. Option ng team yan, kundi hindi ka mapapa-pirma, free agent&amp;nbsp; ka (Governors decided that all players with expiring contracts can be extended until Dec. 31. It will be an option for the teams; those who won&amp;rsquo;t be extended will become free agents),&amp;rdquo; Marcial said during yesterday&amp;rsquo;s online PSA Forum.

A number of PBA stars will see their current pacts lapsing either end of July or August, led by San Miguel&amp;rsquo;s Arwind Santos and Alex Cabagnot, whose original deals expire next month.

The PBA exec added the extension could even stretch to January 2021 if the eyed tournament resumes and its championship series goes beyond December.

&amp;ldquo;Swerte ng players, may PBA o wala, may kontrata sila hanggang Dec. 31,&amp;rdquo; said Marcial.

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; The Philippine Sports Commission has asked the National Bureau of Investigation to look deeper into the alleged &amp;ldquo;athletes-padding&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;payroll scam&amp;rdquo; perpetuated by an employee of the government sports agency.

&amp;ldquo;We have sought the help of the NBI on the matter so we cannot comment further,&amp;rdquo; said PSC officer-in-charge Ramon Fernandez in a statement yesterday.

In a two-page letter dated July 10, 2020, addressed to NBI officer-in-charge Eric Distor, PSC executive director Merlita Ibay pointed to the employee as Paul Michael Padua Ignacio of the agency&amp;rsquo;s personnel department.

Ibay was alerted of the possible fraud when she received a letter from Marietta Cabusao, assistant vice president of LandBank of the Philippines Century Park Hotel branch, pertaining to &amp;ldquo;unusual payroll transactions&amp;rdquo; credited to the account of Ignacio.

The modus Ignacio allegedly used was to enlist athletes and coaches no longer under the PSC, and putting the former&amp;rsquo;s bank account in their stead. Ignacio is in charge of preparing the payroll register of the national athletes and coaches.

There were reports the alleged fraudulent act has been going on for five years now, and has resulted to loss of government money amounting to millions.

&amp;ldquo;Suffice it to say, that there were red-flags, which alerted us, and so we acted accordingly. We hope that we can get to the truth and bring the accountable to justice swiftly,&amp;rdquo; said Fernandez.

                <![CDATA[<p>MANILA, Philippines &mdash; The Philippine Sports Commission has asked the National Bureau of Investigation to look deeper into the alleged &ldquo;athletes-padding&rdquo; or &ldquo;payroll scam&rdquo; perpetuated by an employee of the government sports agency.</p><p>&ldquo;We have sought the help of the NBI on the matter so we cannot comment further,&rdquo; said PSC officer-in-charge Ramon Fernandez in a statement yesterday.</p><p>In a two-page letter dated July 10, 2020, addressed to NBI officer-in-charge Eric Distor, PSC executive director Merlita Ibay pointed to the employee as Paul Michael Padua Ignacio of the agency&rsquo;s personnel department.</p><p>Ibay was alerted of the possible fraud when she received a letter from Marietta Cabusao, assistant vice president of LandBank of the Philippines Century Park Hotel branch, pertaining to &ldquo;unusual payroll transactions&rdquo; credited to the account of Ignacio.</p><p>The modus Ignacio allegedly used was to enlist athletes and coaches no longer under the PSC, and putting the former&rsquo;s bank account in their stead. Ignacio is in charge of preparing the payroll register of the national athletes and coaches.</p><p>There were reports the alleged fraudulent act has been going on for five years now, and has resulted to loss of government money amounting to millions.</p><p>&ldquo;Suffice it to say, that there were red-flags, which alerted us, and so we acted accordingly. We hope that we can get to the truth and bring the accountable to justice swiftly,&rdquo; said Fernandez.</p>

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; With fingers crossed and prayers for Divine Providence, POC first vice president Joey Romasanta said the other day he&amp;rsquo;s hoping the Tokyo Olympics will proceed as rescheduled on July 23-Aug. 8 next year &amp;ldquo;in fairness to the athletes&amp;rdquo; but the fate of the Summer Games remains in the balance because of the uncertainty in creating the vaccine to neutralize the COVID-19 pandemic.

&amp;ldquo;Without a vaccine, even assuming Japan&amp;rsquo;s situation is manageable, what about the other countries?&amp;rdquo; said Romasanta. &amp;ldquo;About 10,000 athletes are coming together from around the world for the Olympics and there will also be coaches, trainers, therapists and many others. Will they all be swab-tested? Will they be quarantined and if so, for how long? If anyone tests positive, where will she or he go?&amp;rdquo;

Romasanta said it&amp;rsquo;s been suggested to reduce the sports in the Tokyo calendar to lessen participation and lower the risk of transmission. &amp;ldquo;But if they do that, it will be a long debate and kawawa ang mga atleta na qualified but &amp;lsquo;di makakapunta because nawala ang kanilang sports,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The move to hold the Olympics has a historical purpose which is to preserve the Olympic cycle. It&amp;rsquo;s also to keep the commitment to sponsors. Japan has spent billions to prepare for the Olympics and the infrastructure is ready. What will happen to Japan&amp;rsquo;s investment without the Olympics?&amp;rdquo;

If the Tokyo Games are called off, it won&amp;rsquo;t be the first time for the Olympics. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 cancelled the 1916 Olympics which were scheduled in Germany. The 1940 Summer and Winter Olympics were supposed to be held in Japan but were both scrapped because of World War II. Japan actually forfeited its hosting rights and Helsinki was tapped to host the 1940 Summer Games and the German town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen the 1940 Winter Games. Neither took place. In 1944, London was supposed to host the Summer Games and Cortina d&amp;rsquo;Ampezzo in Italy, the Winter Games. But both were abandoned since World War II still raged.

Tokyo Organizing Committee president Yoshiro Mori said if the Games don&amp;rsquo;t push through next year, they will be scrapped with no more postponement. &amp;ldquo;Unless an effective vaccine is developed, I expect hosting the Olympics will be difficult,&amp;rdquo; said Japan Medical Association president Yoshitake Yokokura, quoted by Michelle Bruton in&amp;nbsp;forbes.com. Before the postponement to next year, Japan had already spent $12.6 billion to prepare for the Olympics. The delay has added $2.7 billion to the bill. If the Olympics are cancelled, Japan will stand to lose over $22.3 billion. Included in the tab would be the opportunity loss of $1 billion in ticket sales.

Romasanta said Olympic-bound athletes will be hard hit if the Games are lost. Some may think of retiring because waiting four years for another Olympics might not be an option. Some may lose interest in sports and look into other ventures to make a living. Athletes who are prevented from training because of COVID-19 area restrictions are also in a bind.

Romasanta, who is concurrently LVPI president, said the postponement of the Asian Men&amp;rsquo;s Club Volleyball Championships in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, was expected. It was scheduled last April 18-25 and tentatively reset to Aug. 10-17. &amp;ldquo;Athletes can&amp;rsquo;t be switched on and off, they follow a training program that comes in stages,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It takes a minimum of three months of continuous preparation for a competition. In the last SEA Games, our men&amp;rsquo;s volleyball team trained for three months, every day, starting at 7 a.m. in the Arellano Gym. John Vic (De Guzman) was our captain and led the team. The hard work paid off as we got the silver. At the moment, there&amp;rsquo;s still no approval from the IATF for teams in non-pro sports to restart training. Players want to play but the country has bigger priorities for everyone to be safe and to boost our economy.&amp;rdquo;

                <![CDATA[MANILA, Philippines &amp;mdash; Dottie Ardina left for the US the other day, ready to re-launch her campaign in a cutthroat battle for top honors and Olympic ranking points with the LPGA and Symetra Tour calendars reduced in half due to global health crisis.

The 26-year-old Canlubang pro expects to land a spot in the 144-player field in the first LPGA event in four months following the coronavirus pandemic &amp;ndash; the LPGA Drive On Championship, a $1 million, 54-hole tournament firing off July 31 at the par-71 Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio.

The event, which will be played without sponsors, a pro-am and spectators, is actually the first of back-to-back LPGA tournaments in Ohio with the Marathon Classic, offering a richer purse of $2 million over four days, slated on Aug. 6-9 at the Highland Meadow Golf Club in Sylvania.

The LPGA is actually keeping the rosters in both events under wraps but Ardina is confident of making it to the twin tournaments, raring to slug it out with the elite field all hungry for recognition and itching to showcase their form coming off a long four-month break due to the pandemic.

Holder of a regular LPGA card, the ICTSI-backed shotmaker is also expected to compete in the Symetra Tour which will also re-open shop next week with the FireKeepers Casino Hotel Championship at the Battle Creek Country Club in Michigan slated July 24-26.

Like Ardina, 2019 SEA Games double gold medalist Bianca Pagdanganan is also eyeing a spot in Ohio.

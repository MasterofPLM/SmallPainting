It's my own try on exercises in OpenCV-Python Tutorials:
http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

1.opencv5_exercise.py is a paint application with adjustable colors and brush radius using trackbars. 

2.exercise.py is acturally the opencv7_exercise
it can create a slide show of images in a folder with smooth transition between images.
